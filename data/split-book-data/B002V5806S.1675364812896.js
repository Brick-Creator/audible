As her 100th year draws near, she decides to record the events of her life, hiding the manuscript beneath the floorboards. <p>Meanwhile, the hospital is preparing to close and is evaluating its patients to determine whether they can return to society. Dr. Grene, Roseanne's caretaker, takes a special interest in her case.
