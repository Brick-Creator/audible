It’s summertime and he’s spending this one infinitely repeating day reading his way through the town library. Then he discovers&nbsp;someone else in the loop with him: the brilliant, haunted Margaret. Together Mark and Margaret set out to find every wonderful, amazing, perfect thing that happens in that one day - a journey that will take them to the dark secret that waits at the very heart of their endless day.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thrilling, funny, and deeply romantic, this novella is perfect for fans of John Green, Nicola Yoon, and Jandy Nelson.</p>";
