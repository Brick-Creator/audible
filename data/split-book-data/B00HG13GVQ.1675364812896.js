window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book One of The Goldanders War trilogy. Previously published as <i>Oberonâ€™s Dreams</i>. </p> <p>Even for a charismatic pirate, three years is a long time to chase after an unimaginable treasure hidden in the ruins of an ancient city. But when the fabled riches turn out to be virtually worthless, the outraged crew mutinies and leaves their former captain for dead. </p> <p>He is rescued by a mysterious king and transported back to a time of dwarves, druids, and fairies. Enchanting as it is, though, his only wish is to return home and find justice - but only the king has the power to return him...for a price. </p> <p>Aided by a new and motley group of mystical creatures and misfits, he sets out on his quest, ultimately getting caught up in a war he wants nothing to do with - and in the process changing the course of history itself. </p> <p><i>The Dreams of a Dying God</i> is an action-packed, richly imagined adventure fantasy from the author of The Dragonprince trilogy.</p>";
