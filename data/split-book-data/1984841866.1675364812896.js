window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Every person wrongfully convicted of a crime at some point dreams of getting revenge against the system. In&nbsp;</b><b><i>Confessions of an Innocent Man</i></b><b>, the dream comes true and in a spectacular way.” (John Grisham,&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times&nbsp;</i></b><b>best-selling author of</b><b><i>&nbsp;The Reckoning</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>A thrillingly suspenseful debut novel and a fierce howl of rage that questions the true meaning of justice.</b></p> <p>Rafael Zhettah relishes the simplicity and freedom of his life. He is the owner and head chef of a promising Houston restaurant, a pilot with open access to the boundless Texas horizon, and a bachelor, content with having few personal or material attachments that ground him. Then, lightning strikes. When he finds Tieresse - billionaire, philanthropist, sophisticate, bombshell - sitting at one of his tables, he also finds his soul mate, and his life starts again. And just as fast, when she is brutally murdered in their home, when he is convicted of the crime, when he is sentenced to die, it is all ripped away. But for Rafael Zhettah, death row is not the end. It is only the beginning. Now, with his recaptured freedom, he will stop at nothing to deliver justice to those who stole everything from him.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a heart-stoppingly suspenseful, devastating, pause-resisting debut novel. A thriller with a relentless grip that wants you to listen to it in one sitting. David R. Dow has dedicated his life to the fight against capital punishment - to righting the horrific injustices of the death-penalty regime in Texas. He delivers the perfect modern parable for exploring our complex, uneasy relationships with punishment and reparation in a terribly unjust world.</p>";
