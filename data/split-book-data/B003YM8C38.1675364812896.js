window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michael Pollan’s unmatched ability to draw lines of connection between our everyday experiences - whether eating, gardening, or building - and the natural world has been the basis for the popular success of his many works of nonfiction, including the genre-defining best sellers <i>The Botany of Desire</i>, <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</i>, and <i>In Defense of Food</i>. With this updated edition of his earlier book, <i>A Place of My Own</i>, listeners can revisit the inspired, intelligent, and often hilarious story of Pollan’s realization of a room of his own—a small, wooden hut, his “shelter for daydreams” — built with his admittedly unhandy hands. Inspired by both Thoreau and Mr. Blandings, <i>A Place of My Own</i> not only works to convey the history and meaning of all human building, it also marks the connections between our bodies, our minds, and the natural world.</p>";
