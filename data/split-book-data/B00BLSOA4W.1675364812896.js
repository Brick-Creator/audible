window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>How to Fail</i> is the world's FIRST Self-Hurt Guide, the polar opposite of a self-help guide. In <i>How to Fail</i>, follow the misadventures, misgivings, and massive mistakes of this satiric novel's narrator, Stu Fish, as he tries to find success in 2010 New York. With hilarious chapters such as \"How to Fail to Make Your Parents Proud of You,\" \"How to Fail to Do Something Productive All Day,\" \"How to Fail in Love,\" and \"How to Fail All the Way to Rock Bottom,\" and even more ribald \"footchapters\" such as \"How to Masturbate at Work,\" \"How to Develop an Addiction,\" \"How to Get Usurped by Your Girlfriend's Ex,\" and \"How to Acquire the STD That's Right for You,\" there's not an aspect of life that <i>How to Fail</i> doesn't tackle and offer a terrific non-solution for. All of this is delivered in perfect single serving-size chapters for our modern A.D.D. culture more used to reading blog entries on their phones while riding the subway or waiting in line at Subway than in carefully reading a book.</p>";
