window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of the international best seller <i>The Stone Man</i>, short-listed for Audible UK's Book of the Year Award 2015. </p><p>Here are the rules. </p><p>Method: you can't use a gun. You can't use explosives. You can't use poison. It has to be up close and personal. You don't have to worry about leaving evidence; that will be taken care of. </p><p>Victim: no one suicidal. No one over the age of 65. No one with a terminal illness. </p><p>Choose your method. Choose your victim. </p><p>Chris Summer was a 21-year-old call centre worker. A dropout. A nobody, still living at home with his parents. Then one day the Man in White came to his family's house, offering a seemingly impossible choice: kill a random stranger - one of Chris' choosing - within 12 days in order to save the lives of five kidnapped siblings. Refuse, and they die slowly and painfully. </p><p>The clock is ticking, the Man in White is watching and Chris has some very important choices to make. This is a tale of fear, indecision, confused masculinity and brutal violence - a story of a coddled young man thrust into a world of sharp metal and bone. Ask yourself if you could do it. Then ask yourself who you would choose. </p>";
