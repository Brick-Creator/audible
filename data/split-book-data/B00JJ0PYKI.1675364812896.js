window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There isn’t really a “go to” book - or audiobook - on Scripture. Sure, there are plenty of theological books on Scripture, and lots of popular-level works on how to read Scripture, and more and more books on the whole story line of Scripture. But there is not one book that people turn to for the basics on the Bible. We need a book that college freshmen will read when they have questions, a book that mentors can use and small groups will employ, a book that a Bible class in high school or college might assign. We need a audiobook on the Good Book that is relevant enough to get a hearing, but timeless enough to be read with profit twenty years from now. </p> <p>That’s the sort of book popular author, pastor, and blogger Kevin DeYoung has aimed to write. Addressing the issues of our day - questions related to the reliability, authority, and readability of the Bible - DeYoung tackles these head on, but without complex terminology or a long list of footnotes. Taking God at His Word serves as a comprehensive and comprehensible introduction to a classic, orthodox doctrine of Scripture for the average man or woman in the pew, helping Christians across the globe gain confidence that the Bible really is knowable, necessary, and enough. </p>";
