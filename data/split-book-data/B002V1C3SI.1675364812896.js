window.bookSummaryJSON = "Scott Wilkinson is a successful young advertising executive on his way to the top. Christopher Miller is an FBI legend who has been willing to do whatever it takes to see that justice is done. However, at age 50, he's ready to spend more time with his family. <p>Two weeks before Christmas, Wilkinson goes on a routine business trip that will forever entangle their two lives. It starts like so many others. Wilkinson calls for a car service to take him to the airport. But the driver of Lincoln Town Car 716 is late. When he finally shows up, he drives like a maniac, and Wilkinson feels fortunate to reach the airport alive.</p> <p>Then he makes a big mistake. He calls the limousine company to complain. Customer Service assures him that the bad driver will be \"dealt with\". Nicolai Kyznetsoff looks and sounds like all the anonymous others who whisk successful executives back and forth to the airport every day, but the man behind the wheel of Car 716 is something much more sinister: an avenging dark angel who will stop at nothing to wreak revenge on the one man he holds responsible for ruining his life.</p>";
