window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Keira Saxon’s father was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, she quit her job as a Chicago homicide detective to head home. But she hadn’t been back on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula long before Danny Saxon was dead, killed in a deadly bear attack. Keira bowed to public pressure and agreed to run in the special election to fill the rest of her father’s term as sheriff. Although doubts about the circumstances of Danny's death lingered, doubts were all she had. Until she received a grisly delivery and learned that her father’s death wasn’t an accident at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finn Carstens agrees to partner with Keira’s department to solve the murder. When proof of a second victim comes to light, he realizes that the killer is engaging them in the deadliest of contests. Together they must unmask a man who lives - and kills - in the shadows. As they begin to discover his secrets they realize the chilling truth that only the killer's former victims knew: of all the predators lurking in the Michigan forests, man is the most lethal of all.</p>";
