window.bookSummaryJSON = "Early in his career, A.J. Jacobs put his Ivy League education to work at <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. He emerged five years later knowing which stars have fake boobs, which stars have toupees, which have both, and not much else. This realization led Jacobs on a life-changing quest: to read the entire contents of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, all 33,000 pages, all 44 million words. <p>The mission began in October 2002, with the word \"a-ak\". The word launches hilarious misadventures through 32 volumes, as Jacobs accumulates useful and less-so knowledge, and along the way finds a deep connection with his father, examines the nature of knowledge vs. intelligence, and learns how to be rather annoying at cocktail parties.</p> <p> <i>The Know-It-All</i> is an ingenious, mightily entertaining memoir of one man's intellect, neuroses, and obsessions, and a soul-searching, ultimately touching struggle between the obsessive quest for factual knowledge and the undeniable gift of hard-won wisdom.</p>";
