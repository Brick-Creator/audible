Well...after you’ve made a cup of tea, of course.</b></p> <p>Nathan James is young, successful and has the world at his feet. Unfortunately, he’s also about to die - which ruins things somewhat. And now he’s staring imminent death in the face, Nathan is having to rethink some of his life choices <i>very hard</i>.</p> <p>This means embarking on a hectic journey of self-discovery that includes, amongst other things, losing his dignity to an inescapable bean bag, suffering screaming nightmares about a monstrous potato, and getting up close and <i>very</i> personal with a bipolar donkey.</p> <p>All of which is fine, but then Nathan falls in love with a charming girl called Alison, which is a really stupid thing to do. Because how can you give your heart to someone when it might be about to stop?</p> <p>From Nick Spalding, the bestselling author of <i>Fat Chance</i>, <i>Bricking It</i> and <i>Mad Love</i>, comes a comedy about dying - which is easy - and living, which is most certainly <i>not</i>.</p>";
