window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>After his miracles go viral, one man’s crisis of faith puts everything in doubt, erasing the line between memory, reality, and truth.</b></p> <p>Raised in a poor neighborhood in Albuquerque by his mother and <i>curandera</i> grandmother, Gabriel Romero grows up fervently religious, privately conflicted, and consumed by what he’s certain is the true will of God. A radical activist determined to enlighten the consciousness of a country losing its way, Gabriel starts his own church. His slogans go viral. His protests make him either a hero or an anarchist in a polarized America, and his miracles - if we believe what we see - cast him as either a charlatan or a saint. But Gabriel knows that, above all, to ensure lasting faith he must do something truly memorable. For that, he will see his divine mission to its startling end.</p> <p>In this visionary novel framed as a hagiography, the ruminative, subjective memories of Gabriel’s witnesses - spiritual, familial, romantic, and political - converge to make sense of the man’s confounding works and message. As they do, a surprising portrait develops...not only of the deepening mystery of Gabriel Romero himself but also of a country in conflict and the faith it takes to fight the suspicion and fear that divide us.</p>";
