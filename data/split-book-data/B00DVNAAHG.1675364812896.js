window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Next generation companies don't just cater to existing markets, they create new ones - and they pay Henry Maddox top dollar to show them how. Maddox uses sophisticated marketing strategies to break apart large markets into smaller, more profitable, consumption hungry ones. Combined with modern data mining (known as big data), these techniques allow companies to not only profit from consumers, but control them. </p> <p>But when Henry is forced to face how his techniques affect real people, he realizes he has inadvertently given corporations the power to destroy society for their own ends. <i>The Curtain</i> explores the effect that increasingly sophisticated data manipulation has on our communities, families, and daily lives. </p> <p>In an age of digital distractions, who remembers the transcendent morality that has made past civilizations prosper? When corporations have the technology and motive to pull people apart, what keeps us together? </p>";
