window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Deep in Pennsylvania's Blue Ridge Mountains, a woman befriends a mysterious newcomer from Uzbekistan, setting in motion this suspenseful, atmospheric, politically charged debut.</b></p> <p>After surviving a car crash that left her widowed at 22, Kathleen has retreated to a remote corner of a state park, where she works flipping burgers for deer hunters and hikers - happy, she insists, to be left alone.&nbsp;</p> <p>But when a stranger appears in the dead of winter - seemingly out of nowhere, kicking snow from his flimsy dress shoes - Kathleen is intrigued, despite herself. He says he's a student visiting from Uzbekistan, and his worldliness fills her with curiosity about life beyond the valley. After a cautious friendship settles between them, the stranger confesses to a terrible crime in his home country, and Kathleen finds herself in the grip of a manhunt - and face-to-face with secrets of her own.&nbsp;</p> <p>Steeped in the rugged beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains as America's War on Terror rages in the background, Sarah St.Vincent's <i>Ways to Hide in Winter </i>is a powerful story about violence and redemption, betrayal and empathy, and how we reconcile the unforgivable in those we love.</p>";
