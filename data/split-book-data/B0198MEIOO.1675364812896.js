Chosen as a child, he was raised and trained as an Orphan, an off-the-books black box program designed to create the perfect deniable intelligence asset: An assassin. Evan was Orphan X - until he broke with the program and used everything he learned to disappear. But now someone is on his tail. Someone with similar skills and training who will exploit Evan’s secret new identity as the Nowhere Man to eliminate him.</p> <p><b>“Hurwitz melds nonstop action and high-tech gadgetry...in this excellent series opener.” - </b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b> (starred review</b>)</p>";
