window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"I am Pepe. But you can call me el Jefe.\" Pepe may have soft white fur, big brown eyes, and mucho attitude - but he's no furry fashion fad. Pepe can talk - even if his new owner, Geri Sullivan, seems to be the only person who can understand him. When Geri takes on her first assignment for a quirky investigator named Jimmy G and stumbles over a Seattle millionaire's corpse, Pepe proves to be worth his weight in liver treats. Suspicion falls on the not-so-grieving widow, who wants to finance a reality TV show, <i>Dancing With Dogs.</i> Normally, Pepe wouldn't be caught muerte in a sparkly costume. However, he has to sniff out the real killer and keep Geri safe. Lesser dogs might flinch. But Pepe isn't the kind to turn tail and run...</p>";
