window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The fourth and Final Instalment in the Red Riding Quartet. With <i>Nineteen Eighty Three</i>, David Peace completes the Red Riding Quartet, an astonishing, sustained epic. Three intertwining storylines see the Quartet’s central themes of corruption and the perversion of justice come to a head.</p><p>BJ, the rent boy from 1974; the lawyer Big John Piggott, who’s as near as you get to a hero in Peace’s world; and Maurice Jobson, the senior cop whose career of corruption and brutality has set all this in motion, find themselves on a collision course that can only end in a terrible vengeance.</p><p> David Peace (born 1967) is an English author. He was named one of the Best of Young British Novelists by <i>Granta</i> in 2003 and won the 2004 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction. He is also known for his novels <i>GB84</i> and <i>The Damned United</i>, with the latter made into a feature film starring Michael Sheen.</p>";
