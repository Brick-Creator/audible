window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lad from the streets meets lord of the manor. Both men's lives will be changed forever. </p> <p>When Sir Alan Watleigh goes searching for sex, he never imagines the street rat he brings home for one last bit of pleasure in his darkest hour will be the man who hauls him back from the edge of the grave. Despite his harsh life in the slums of London, Jem is a bright, cheerful young man. He's also witty, irreverent, glib, and makes Alan laugh - a rare occasion since wartime trauma and the death of his family have made the man a ghost of his former self. </p> <p>A single night of meaningless sex turns into an offer of permanent employment. Jem acts as Alan's valet, but offers him so much more than polished boots and starched cravats. Just as the men are adjusting to their new living arrangement, news about a former soldier under his command sends Sir Watleigh and Jem on the road to save a child in danger. </p> <p>The journey brings them closer together as they travel from lust toward love. They rescue the girl from the clutches of an insane surgeon, who is as interested in experimenting on the vulnerable human spirit as he is on physical bodies. Alan realizes his love for Jem when he nearly loses him, but is Alan's love strong enough to risk society discovering the truth about him? And is he strong enough to finally accept his sexual nature? </p> <p>A reissue of the title first published by Loose Id.</p>";
