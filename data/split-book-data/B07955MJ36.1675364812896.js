Despite a successful career in television and a long, prosperous marriage, Laura's world revolves around kind, talented Daniel. She pictures his new girlfriend, Cherry, becoming a close friend and confidante ...one day, even a daughter-in-law. But although Cherry is beautiful and amiable, Laura can't warm to her. There's something about the possessive way she touches Daniel, the little lies Laura detects. Cherry seems to resent Laura, driving a wedge between mother and son - until one day Daniel is injured in a terrible accident.</p> <p>Six months later, with Daniel still in a coma and facing death, Laura makes a fateful decision - and carries out an astonishing deceit. A handsome doctor for a husband, with a trust fund and a family villa in Saint-Tropez - it was all supposed to be Cherry's. Now, instead of living with Daniel in his impeccable home, she's jobless and broke. And then Cherry discovers Laura's stunning deception. But Cherry is too clever, too ambitious to let her get away with it. She has already transformed herself into Daniel's dream woman. Now she'll become Laura's worst nightmare.</p> <p>Author Michelle Frances masterfully weaves both women's perspectives into this gripping, artfully plotted psychological thriller, propelling the listener through one dark twist after another toward a shocking, unforgettable finale.</p>";
