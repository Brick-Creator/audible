window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Timson talks about Charles Dickens, much loved for his great contribution to classic English Literature. Listen to <i>Great Expectations</i> narrated by Anton Lesser.</p><p>In this, perhaps Dickens' most profound and personal novel, we are invited to share in the sentimental education of Pip, the poor boy from the village forge who risks losing himself in snobbery and selfishness when he mysteriously inherits a fortune. The story moves from the bleak Kentish marshes of Pip's childhood to a thrilling climax that mingles tragedy and triumph.</p>";
