window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Jenny inherits her estranged grandmother’s cottage in Sherwood Forest, she has nothing to lose - no money, no job, no friends, no family to speak of, and zero self-respect. Things can only get better....&nbsp;</p> <p>Her grumpy but decidedly handsome new neighbour, Mack, has a habit of bestowing unsolicited good deeds on her. And when Jenny is welcomed into a rather unusual book club, life seems to finally be getting more interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead of reading, the members pledge to complete individual challenges before Christmas: from finding new love and learning to bake to completing a daredevil bucket list. Jenny can’t resist joining in, and soon a year of friendship and laughter, tears and regrets unfolds in the most unexpected ways.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Warm, wise, funny and utterly uplifting. What one thing would you change in your life before Christmas comes around? </b></p>";
