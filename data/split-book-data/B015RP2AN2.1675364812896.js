window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Caitlin Sommers finds herself alone in a deserted parking lot with blood on her clothes and no memory of the past few months, it seems like one of the nightmares that have tormented her for years...but it's all too real. Desperate to learn the truth about where she's been and what has happened to her but terrified of what she may find, Caitlin embarks on a search for answers. Her journey takes her from the safe suburban world she knows to a seedy town she's never heard of, where a terrible truth from her past lies hidden - a truth she can't quite remember yet can't completely forget. </p>";
