window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Fiction, 2016 </b></p> <p>A biting satire about a young man's isolated upbringing and the race trial that sends him to the Supreme Court, Paul Beatty's <i>The Sellout</i> showcases a comic genius at the top of his game. It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality: the black Chinese restaurant. </p> <p>Born in the \"agrarian ghetto\" of Dickens - on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles - the narrator of <i>The Sellout</i> resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: \"I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since the '68 quake.\" </p> <p>Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral. </p> <p>Fuelled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident - the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins - he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court. </p>";
