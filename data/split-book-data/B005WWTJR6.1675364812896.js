window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Benjamín Chaparro is a retired detective still obsessed by the brutal, decades-old rape and murder of a young married woman in her own bedroom. While attempting to write a book about the case, he revisits the details of the investigation. As he reaches into the past, Chaparro also recalls the beginning of his long, unrequited love for Irene Hornos, then just an intern, now a respected judge. Set in the Buenos Aires of the 1970s, Sacheri’s tale reveals the underpinnings of Argentina’s Dirty War and takes on the question of justice - what it really means and in whose hands it belongs. </p> <p>Eduardo Sacheri's first collection of short stories was published in Spain in 2000 under the title <i>Los traidores y otros cuentos.</i> Three other collections were published between 2001 and 2007, all of which have been bestsellers in Argentina. The film adaptation of his novel <i>La pregunta de sus ojos</i> won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2010.</p>";
