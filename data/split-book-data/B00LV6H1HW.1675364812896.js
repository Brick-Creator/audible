window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the Edgar Award-winning author of the <i>Hap and Leonard</i> mysteries comes a shocking crime thriller to chill even the warmest summer's night. By turns vivid, raw, and darkly comedic, this mystery classic inspired the 2014 major motion picture <i>Cold in July</i>, starring Michael C. Hall (<i>Dexter</i>), Sam Shepard (<i>Black Hawk Down</i>), and Don Johnson (<i>Miami Vice</i>). </p> <p>Richard Dane has killed a man. He cannot unhear the firing of the gun or unsee the blood on his living room wall. But everybody in the small town of LaBorde, Texas, knows Dane acted in self-defense. Everybody except Ben Russel, the ex-con father of the small-time criminal who invaded Dane's home. When Russel comes looking for revenge against Dane's family, the two are unexpectedly drawn into a conspiracy that conceals the vilest of crimes. Surrounded by police corruption, mafia deception, and underworld brutality, Dane, Russel, and eccentric PI Jim Bob Luke have discovered a game they may not survive.</p>";
