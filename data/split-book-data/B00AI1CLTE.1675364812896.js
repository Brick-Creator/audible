window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After the brutal murder of an art gallery owner, the beautiful and mysterious artist Holly Troy seems to be the key to finding out what really happened on the night of the homicide. Unfortunately, Holly also suffers from dissociative identity disorder, and many of her personalities come straight from classical mythology, from the powerful Cronos and Pandora to the fickle Fates. Holly has no idea who she was the night of the crime - whether she witnessed anything, or even if she was the killer herself. Homicide detective Orson Cheever must unravel the complex labyrinth of Holly’s mind before he can find the truth, but he soon finds himself drawn into his own past when Holly begins exhibiting the personality of a five-year-old girl. Desperate to solve the crime and escape his own long-buried grief, Cheever plunges ahead, treading the line between investigator and protector in this suspenseful psychological thriller.</p>";
