window.bookSummaryJSON = "Storm Syrell sells antiques in Palm Beach, Florida. An art historian, Storm arranges her life as she does her work - into neat, orderly categories. However, when her grandfather dies under suspicious circumstances, she struggles to uncover clues he left behind in a frayed leather journal. <p>Leaving behind Palm Beach for the untamed wilds of Cypress, Africa, and beyond, Storm is joined by one Harry Bennett - a scruffy, professional treasure hunter (aka, ex-con) who claims he must be the one to help solve her grandfather's murder. Can Storm trust Harry? Does she have a choice?</p> <p>Before long the two form an unlikely alliance as they dash across the globe to figure out what Storm's grandfather had been working on before his death...and get tangled up in a quest for secret historical writings that could spark a new crisis in Middle Eastern politics.</p> <p>Racing from the teeming gold markets of an Arabian souk to the highest ranks of European governments - and even to the depths of the Mediterranean Sea - Storm and Harry set out to find the documents before they fall into the wrong hands. Clearly they're up against some formidable enemies, shady characters who will kill with impunity...and very closely. With seconds to spare, the CIA, FBI, and Interpol become involved in this hot-blooded game of international intrigue, but Storm and Harry may learn the hard way that the only ones they can rely on are themselves.</p>";
