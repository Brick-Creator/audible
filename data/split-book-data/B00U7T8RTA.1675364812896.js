window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michelle Baron should be reveling in her new life in Sandy Cove, Oregon. From the outside it all looks idyllic. A newlywed settling into a quaint coastal town, her husband establishing himself as a junior partner in a law firm - what more could she want? </p> <p>But a series of disturbing nightmares haunts Michelle. Her quest to understand these dreams leads her to the New World bookstore, where she begins a spiritual journey that will challenge her Christian heritage as well as her marriage. </p> <p>Captivating characters, suspenseful story lines, and thought-provoking themes - best-selling author, Rosemary Hines crafts gripping and at times poignant tales of the challenges Christians face in contemporary culture. Known for her realistic portrayal of life and her sensitivity in tackling tough topics, her novels examine the prevalence of New Age beliefs and practices in today's world, the tragedy of suicide that touches families of all walks of life, the broken system of foster care, the need for dedicated teachers to reach out to troubled students, and the heartache of infertility as well as unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Never preachy but always leading the listener to a message of hope and redemption, Rosemary is a committed follower of Christ. The novels of the Sandy Cove series - <i>Out of a Dream</i>, <i>Through the Tears</i>, and <i>Into Magnolia</i> - convey profound Christian messages that touch hearts of believers and nonbelievers alike. Refreshingly honest and true to life, the characters resonate with readers and become their friends, and the story lines transition seamlessly from one novel to the next. </p>";
