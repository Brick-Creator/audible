Determined to improve life for her and her son, Christopher, she flees an abusive relationship in the middle of the night with her child.

Just one highway in, one highway out.&nbsp;</p> <p>At first, it seems like the perfect place to finally settle down. Then Christopher vanishes. For six awful days, no one can find him. Until Christopher emerges from the woods at the edge of town, unharmed but not unchanged. He returns with a voice in his head only he can hear, with a mission only he can complete: Build a tree house in the woods by Christmas, or his mother and everyone in the town will never be the same again.&nbsp;</p> <p>Twenty years ago, Stephen Chbosky's <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i> made audiences everywhere feel infinite. Now, Chbosky has returned with an epic work of literary horror, years in the making, whose grand scale and rich emotion redefine the genre. Listent to it with the lights on.</p>";
