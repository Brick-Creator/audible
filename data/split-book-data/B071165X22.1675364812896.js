window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>USA Today</i> and Amazon number-one best-selling author. </p> <p>One of the best new voices in the action thriller genre. </p> <p>David Archer is back with a vengeance with his newest hero, Noah Wolf. After fans raved about his debut series, The Sam Prichard Novels, Archer now is about to back even harder. People are already throwing out names like Mitch Rapp and Alex Cross, but don't take my word for it. See what all the fuss is about before Archer becomes a household name! </p> <p>After recovering from the shock of Neverland's recent attack, Noah and the team are sent back into the field to identify and eliminate a power player who uses his position as a legitimate arms dealer to manipulate terror groups and nations alike. Unfortunately, this means infiltrating the man's organization, and the only opening he's got is for an assassin of his own. Impersonating a recently eliminated assassin-for-hire, Noah makes his way through the ranks to the top leadership, but then comes the surprise. The Top Dog isn't who the government thought he was, and the truth will have repercussions that will rock the world. </p>";
