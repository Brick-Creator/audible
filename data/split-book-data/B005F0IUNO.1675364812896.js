window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fifteen years ago Susan Morrow left her first husband, Edward Sheffield, an unpublished writer. Now she's enduring middle-class suburbia as a doctor's wife when out of the blue she receives a package containing the manuscript of her ex-husband's first novel. He writes asking her to read the book; she was always his best critic, he says. </p> <p>As Susan reads, she is drawn into the fictional life of Tony Hastings, a math professor driving his family to their summer house in Maine. And as we read with her, we, too, become lost in Sheffield's thriller. As the Hastings' ordinary, civilized lives are disastrously, violently sent off course, Susan is plunged back into the past, forced to confront the darkness that inhabits her, and driven to name the fear that gnaws at her future and will change her life. </p>";
