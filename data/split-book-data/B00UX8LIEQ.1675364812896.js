Though ostensibly fiction, <i>The Perfect Stranger</i> recreates in vivid, unmistakable detail the terrible day she became hostage to a dark secret, a secret that only one other person knew - and that person is dead. </p> <p>Now that the past is catching up with her, Catherine's world is falling apart. Her only hope is to confront what really happened on that awful day - even if the shocking truth might destroy her. </p>";
