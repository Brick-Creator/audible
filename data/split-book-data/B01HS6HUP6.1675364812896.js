window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Pushcart Prize nominee Danny Johnson comes a powerful, lyrical debut novel that explores race relations, first love, and coming of age in North Carolina in the 1950s and '60s. </p> <p>At eight years old, Raeford \"Junebug\" Hurley has known more than his share of hard lessons. After the sudden death of his parents, he goes to live with his grandparents on a farm surrounded by tobacco fields and lonesome woods. There he meets Fancy Stroud and her twin brother, Lightning, the children of black sharecroppers on a neighboring farm. As years pass, the friendship between Junebug and bright, compassionate Fancy takes on a deeper intensity. Junebug, aware of all the ways in which he and Fancy are more alike than different, habitually bucks against the casual bigotry that surrounds them - dangerous in a community ruled by the Klan. </p> <p>On the brink of adulthood, Junebug is drawn into a moneymaking scheme that goes awry - and leaves him with a dark secret he must keep from those he loves. And as Fancy, tired of saying yes'um and living scared, tries to find her place in the world, Junebug embarks on a journey that will take him through loss and war toward a hard-won understanding. </p> <p>At once tender and unflinching, <i>The Last Road Home</i> delves deep into the gritty, violent realities of the South's turbulent past, yet evokes the universal hunger for belonging. </p>";
