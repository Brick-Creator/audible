Detective Merci Rayborn, young enough to be his daughter, is brash, impatient, and not someone from whom Hess wants to be taking orders. He certainly isn't planning on falling in love with her.... <br>Together, they must track down a psychopathic killer who's been abducting beautiful young women from the malls of Orange County. Dubbed the \"Purse Snatcher\" for the chilling way he brags about his shockingly distinctive crimes, he is one of T. Jefferson Parker's most original creations.";
