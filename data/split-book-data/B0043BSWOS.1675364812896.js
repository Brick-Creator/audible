window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is the second volume of Faulkner's trilogy about the Snopes family, his symbol for the grasping, destructive element in the post-bellum South. Like its predecessor, <i>The Hamlet</i>, and its successor, <i>The Mansion</i>, <i>The Town</i> is completely self-contained, but it gains resonance from the other two. </p> <p>The story of Flem Snopes' ruthless struggle to take over the town of Jefferson, Mississippi, the book is rich in typically Faulknerian episodes of humor and of profundity. </p> <p><b>As an added bonus, when you purchase our Audible Modern Vanguard production of William Faulkner's book, you'll also receive an exclusive Jim Atlas interview. This interview – where James Atlas interviews James Lee Burke about the life and work of William Faulkner – begins as soon as the audiobook ends. </b></p>";
