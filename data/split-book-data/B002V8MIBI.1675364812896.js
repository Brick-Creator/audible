At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, <i>Frankenstein</i> tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein.</p> <p> Obsessed with discovering \"the cause of generation and life\" and \"bestowing animation upon lifeless matter\", Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts. However, upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. </p> <p></p>Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein. <p></p> <p><i>Frankenstein</i>, an instant best seller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science-fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? And how far can we go in tampering with Nature?</p>";
