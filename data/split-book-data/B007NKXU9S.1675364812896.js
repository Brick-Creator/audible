window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Peter Behrens' eagerly awaited second novel is <i>The O’Briens.</i> In the character of Joe O’Brien - ambitious railroad magnate and industrialist, fiercely loyal family man, brooding troubled soul - he gives us one of the most compelling and complex characters to come along in years. A brilliant follow-up to <i>The Law of Dreams,</i> and yet standing masterfully on its own, <i>The O’Briens</i> is a tragic, romantic, and ultimately hopeful epic of great heart, imagination and narrative force.</p>";
