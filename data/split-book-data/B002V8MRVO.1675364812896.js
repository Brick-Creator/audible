window.bookSummaryJSON = "There is a kind of man God uses. He stands tall in the face of giants. He strives to honor God through his life. He is trusting when it seems all hope is lost. And when life is uncertain, he is certain of God's unfailing provision. <i>Battle Ready</i> is for any man who longs to serve God. Inside you'll explore the lives of men who made an impact in their world, including Joshua, who led the Israelites into the Promised Land, and Caleb, who trusted God and not himself for victory in battle.

Become men who are battle ready! <i>Battle Ready </i>is a follow-up to <i>God Built</i>, and part of the Bold Men of God series.";
