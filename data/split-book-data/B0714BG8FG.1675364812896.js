window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A breakout romantic comedy by the best-selling author of five critically acclaimed novels.</b> </p> <p>Who says you can't run away from your problems? </p> <p>You are a failed novelist about to turn 50. A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: Your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can't say yes - it would be too awkward - and you can't say no - it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world. </p> <p>Question: How do you arrange to skip town? </p> <p>Answer: You accept them all. </p> <p>What would possibly go wrong? </p> <p>Arthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: He will turn 50. Through it all there is his first love. And there is his last. </p> <p>Because despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings, and mistakes, <i>Less</i> is, above all, a love story. </p> <p>A scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author the <i>New York Times</i> has hailed as \"inspired, lyrical\", \"elegiac\", and \"ingenious\" as well as \"too sappy by half\", <i>Less</i> shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy. </p>";
