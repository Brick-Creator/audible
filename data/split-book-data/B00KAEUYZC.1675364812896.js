window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dan blamed himself for his wife's untimely death...at first, that is. Dan, a newly published best-selling author, has just begun to taste the good life: money in the bank, house in a quiet neighborhood, beautiful wife. His monster of a fictional character - a wealthy, handsome, womanizing murderer - is the catalyst for Dan's good fortune, intriguing millions of fans. But when Dan sleeps with his agent on a business trip, and then confesses the whole thing to his wife in near tears, he sets off a chain of events that cause him to lose his wife and his grip on everything, including reality.</p> <p> Fleeing his hometown in an attempt to outrun tormenting memories, Dan lands himself in a nearly forgotten small town in Oklahoma, taking up indefinite refuge in a Bed and Breakfast. While here, Dan's demons begin to prey on his mental instability, and the character that he's thrilled his readers with begins to come off the page and out into the flesh, sending shockwaves through the otherwise peaceful town, and giving Dan some interesting and horrific ideas on how to cope with his pain.</p> <p><b>WARNING</b>: This book contains graphic violence and extreme psychological deterioration. If those things aren't your cup of tea, stop here.</p>";
