window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A bomb hooked to a banker's back, a one-eyed busted-out former cop, hooker/biker bars on Airline Highway in New Orleans, drugs in the French Quarter, a 300-pound female bartender, an ex-con whose main goal in life is to have more expensive shoes than anyone else, a drug czar named Fidel Castro (a cousin of the more famous one in Cuba), money laundering schemes, and a criminal genius, who enjoys pulling his victim's fingernails out with pliers and who did everything right in what should have been the perfect crime save for one tiny mistake-all assembled and put into motion by an author who was a real-life criminal and ex-con and was advised that if he didn't publish this book but instead used it to create the perfect crime he'd make a lot more? This is what you get (and more) in Les Edgerton's <i>The Perfect Crime</i></p>.";
