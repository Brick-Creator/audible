window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Introducing a new multicast drama by L. J. Ross, the author of the international number one best-selling series, the DCI Ryan mysteries.&nbsp;</p> <p>There's a serial killer targeting the streets of Newcastle, seemingly picking his victims at random but subjecting them all to the same torturous end. When the Chief Inspector on the case goes missing, it falls on DCI Ryan to track down the man who is brutally murdering women and goading the police to 'catch me if you can'.&nbsp;</p> <p>As everyone becomes a suspect, Ryan and his team get drawn further and further into the case, but for Ryan the nightmare gets closer to home than he could ever have imagined.&nbsp;</p> <p>This Audible Original drama stars Tom Bateman (<i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>, <i>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</i>, <i>Snatched</i>), Bertie Carvel (<i>Doctor Foster</i>, <i>Les Misérables</i>), Hermione Norris (<i>Spooks</i>, <i>Cold Feet</i>) and Kevin Whately (<i>Lewis</i>, <i>Auf Wiedersehen, Pet</i>) and is a prequel to the DCI Ryan series.</p> <p>Starring: Alun Armstrong, Rachel Atkins, Tom Bateman, Mark Bazeley, Anna Bolton, Bertie Carvel, Stephen Critchlow, Vicki Davids, Reece Dinsdale, Harriet Ghost, Frances Jeater, Jack Lloyd, Dean Logan, Daniel Matthew Lemon, Roger May, Hermione Norris, Kate Okello, Colleen Prendergast, Shaun Prendergast, Nicholas Rowe, David Seddon, Marlene Sidaway, Tom Slatter, Fiona Victory, Lauren Waine, Kevin Whately and Hannah Wood</p> <p><b>Audible member reviews</b></p> <p>“I was going to listen to a bit whilst I swept and cleaned the floors and then I had work to do that just couldn't wait any more. I am now the proud owner of the cleanest floor in the UK, and possibly the world! I just couldn't stop, it's a totally gripping and absorbing dramatisation. It was fascinating listening, especially as a long standing fan of LJ Ross' DCI Ryan series, and the idea of giving listeners the back story to how the team came together is inspired. A standing ovation for <i>The Infirmary</i>.” – Melanie, Audible member</p> <p>“If, like me, you are a DCI Ryan fan then you will already know what this story is about. If you haven't yet met DCI Ryan and his crew then you are in for a treat as this starts the series off in the most chilling of ways. I could feel the goose bumps rising, my skin crawling as you got that absolute detachment, especially from Bertie Carvel as he divulged the killer's thoughts to the listener. With all the thrills and spills of your favourite DCI Ryan novels, brought to life by a stellar cast, this book will hook you from the action filled opening, through the story's dark and chilling heart, to its sad but inevitable conclusion.” – Jen, Audible member</p> <p>“If you haven't read any DCI Ryan before, you are in for such a treat, and if you have, you are going to LOVE how this brings those much-loved characters completely to life. This Audible Original takes us back to the beginning, and we come to understand how and why Ryan ended up on Holy Island in Book One. With the cast of wonderful characters: Frank, Denise, Jack and the return of Arthur Griegson (superbly played by Alun Armstrong - one of my favourite actors), Ryan is hunting down The Hacker - the killer that has haunted him throughout the series so far. Bertie Carvel stood out for me: a fantastic, spine-chilling performance as the serial killer that has turned Newcastle into a ghost town. Oh, my skin crawled! So many great performances, and I was thrilled to hear genuine North East actors and accents which, along with the music and sound effects, brought authenticity to the whole story. Wonderful stuff.” – Nicky, Audible member</p>";
