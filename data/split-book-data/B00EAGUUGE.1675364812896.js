The savagery shocked a young, divided nation. Against this backdrop of the birth of modern warfare and the painful rebirth of the United States, Peters has created a breathtaking narrative. </p> <p>In <i>Hell or Richmond</i>, 30 days of ceaseless carnageare seen through the eyes of a compelling cast, from the Union's Harvard-valedictorian \"boy general,\" Francis Channing Barlow, to the brawling \"dirty boots\" Rebel colonel, William C. Oates. From Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee to a simple laborer destined to win the Medal of Honor, Peters brings to life an enthralling array of leaders and simple soldiers from both North and South, fleshing out history with stunning, knowledgeable realism. </p> <p>From the horrific collision of armies in the Wilderness, where neither side wanted to fight, to the shocking slaughter of the grand charge at Cold Harbor, this epic novel delivers a compelling, authentic, andsuspenseful portrait of Civil War combat. </p> <p>Commemorating the approaching 150th anniversary of this grim encounter between valiant Americans, Ralph Peters brings to bear the lessons of his own military career, his lifelong study of this war and the men who fought it, and his skills as a best-selling, prize-winning novelist to portray horrific battles and sublime heroism as no other author has done.</p>";
