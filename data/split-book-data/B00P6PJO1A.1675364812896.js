window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bobby Hale is a Union veteran several times over. After the war, he sets his sights on California, but only makes it to Montana. As he stumbles around the West, from the Wyoming Territory to the Black Hills of the Dakotas, he finds meaning in the people he meets - settlers and native people - and the violent history he both participates in and witnesses. <i>Far as the Eye Can See</i> is the story of life in a place where every minute is an engagement in a kind of war of survival, and how two people - a white man and a mixed-race woman - in the midst of such majesty and violence can manage to find a pathway to their own humanity. </p><p>Robert Bausch is the distinguished author of a body of work that is lively and varied, but linked by a thoughtfully complicated masculinity and an uncommon empathy. The unique voice of Bobby Hale manages to evoke both Cormac McCarthy and Mark Twain, guiding readers into Indian country and the Plains Wars in a manner both historically true and contemporarily relevant, as thoughts of race and war occupy the national psyche.</p>";
