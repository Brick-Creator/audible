window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The dance between the viewer and the viewed drives the stories of <i>I Like to Watch,</i> the first-ever anthology of erotica for gay voyeurs and exhibitionists. In the words of editor Christopher Pierce, \"The possibilities are as varied as the individuals who have watched and performed this ritual since the first Cro-Magnon man accidentally saw two men getting it on and decided to stay and watch the show.\" </p> <p>No fantasy is left unfulfilled in this collection devoted to spying, ogling, teasing, flaunting, and showing off for a lover - or a stranger. Every exhibitionist needs a voyeur - and in the intimately charged scenarios of <i>I Like to Watch</i>, the special thrill of getting caught is as much fun as completely shedding one's inhibitions.</p>";
