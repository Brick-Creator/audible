window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can a priest, his brother, and the brother's girlfriend solve a murder case and see justice done - or will they be the murderer's latest victim? <i>A Murder on Wall Street</i> takes us inside the world of Captain O'Brian's Irish Pub and Cigar Bar in Manhattan, a legendary hotspot in the Financial District. Investigating the death are pub owners Joey Mancuso, fired from the New York Police Department for his unorthodox methods, and his brother Father Dominic, who isn't your typical priest. Also investigating is Marcy Martinez, a Cuban bombshell and FBI agent who is Joey's girlfriend. </p> <p>When a customer kills himself after celebrating the night before, the three know something's wrong. Turns out, the customer's death coincides with people losing money - lots of it - and some of those people are very, very dangerous. </p>";
