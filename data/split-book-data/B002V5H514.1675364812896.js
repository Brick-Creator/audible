window.bookSummaryJSON = "The late Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño has been called the García Marquez of his generation. <p><i>The Savage Detectives</i> is a hilarious and sexy, meandering and melancholy, companionable and complicated road trip through Mexico City, Barcelona, Israel, Liberia, and finally the desert of northern Mexico. It is the first of Bolaño's two giant works, with <i>2666</i>, to be translated into English and is already being hailed as a masterpiece.</p>";
