window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of </b><b><i>A Ladder to the Sky</i></b><b> - “a darkly funny novel that races like a beating heart” (</b><b><i>People</i></b><b>) - comes a new novel that plays out across all of human history: a story as precise as it is unlimited. </b></p> <p>This story starts with a family. For now, it is a father and a mother with two sons, one with his father’s violence in his blood, one with his mother’s artistry. One leaves. One stays. They will be joined by others whose deeds will determine their fate. It is a beginning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Their stories will intertwine and evolve over the course of 2,000 years. They will meet again and again at different times and in different places. From Palestine at the dawn of the first millennium and journeying across 50 countries to a life among the stars in the third, the world will change around them, but their destinies remain the same. It must play out as foretold.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the award-winning author of <i>The Heart’s Invisible Furies</i> comes <i>A Traveler at the Gates of Wisdom</i>, an epic tale of humanity. The story of all of us, stretching across two millennia. Imaginative, unique, heartbreaking, this is John Boyne at his most creative and compelling.&nbsp;</p>";
