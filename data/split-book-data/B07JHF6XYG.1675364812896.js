window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A psychotic with an ear for melodies. A detective trapped inside his own mind. Can he catch the killer before the final beat?</b></p> <p>Welsh Inspector Ian Drake barely manages to keep his OCD under control. So, after two fellow police officers are brutally murdered on an isolated mountain route, the pressure to solve the case threatens to make him crack. But Drake feels his carefully constructed world falling apart when the killer taunts him with cryptic song lyrics and promises of more death.</p> <p>As tensions build to a crescendo - both at home and at work - the weary detective’s fears are realized when a local politician appears slain by the same sinister hand. And as Drake keeps receiving the culprit’s cruel verses, his head pounds at the thought of more victims marching to their doom.</p> <p>Can he catch the sociopathic felon before he loses his sanity...or his life?</p> <p><i>Brass in Pocket</i> is the first book in the dynamic Inspector Drake crime series. If you like police procedurals, clever mysteries, and gripping thrillers, then you’ll love Stephen Puleston’s unnerving whodunit.</p>";
