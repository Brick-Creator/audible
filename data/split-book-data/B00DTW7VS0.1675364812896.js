window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A priest changes the lives of an actress running from her past and a man hiding from his future in this heartfelt novel about loss and redemption.</b></p> <p>When someone wants to be lost, a home tucked among the Ten Thousand Islands off the Florida coast is a good place to live. Take a couple decent boats and a deep knowledge of fishing, and Sunday can get by without ever having to talk to another soul. It's a nice enough existence, until the one person who ties Sunday to the world of the living asks him for help.&nbsp;</p> <p>Father Steady Capri knows quite a bit about helping others. But he is afraid Katie Quinn's problems may be beyond his abilities. Katie is a world-famous actress with an all too familiar story. Fame seems to have driven her to self-destruct. Steady knows the true cause of her desire to end her life is buried too deeply for him to reach. But there is one person who still may be able to save her from herself: Sunday.</p> <p>He will show her an alternate escape, a way to write a new life, but Katie still must confront her past before she can find peace.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, Sunday will need to leave his secluded home and sacrifice the serenity he's found to help her.&nbsp;</p>";
