window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"An amazing achievement... A compulsively readable novel, so canny and weird and surfeited with the reality of human capacity and ingenuity that I am stymied for comparison. Dickens and David Lynch? Defoe meets Margaret Atwood? Judge for yourself.\" (Gregory Maguire, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Wicked</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The wry, macabre, unforgettable tale of an ambitious orphan in Revolutionary Paris, befriended by royalty and radicals, who transforms herself into the legendary Madame Tussaud. </b></p> <p>In 1761, a tiny, odd-looking girl named Marie is born in a village in Switzerland. After the death of her parents, she is apprenticed to an eccentric wax sculptor and whisked off to the seamy streets of Paris, where they meet a domineering widow and her quiet, pale son. Together, they convert an abandoned monkey house into an exhibition hall for wax heads, and the spectacle becomes a sensation.&nbsp;</p> <p>As word of her artistic talent spreads, Marie is called to Versailles, where she tutors a princess and saves Marie Antoinette in childbirth. But outside the palace walls, Paris is roiling: The revolutionary mob is demanding heads, and...at the wax museum, heads are what they do.</p> <p>In the tradition of Gregory Maguire's <i>Wicked</i> and Erin Morgenstern's <i>The Night Circus</i>, Edward Carey's <i>Little</i> is a darkly endearing cavalcade of a novel - a story of art, class, determination, and how we hold on to what we love.</p>";
