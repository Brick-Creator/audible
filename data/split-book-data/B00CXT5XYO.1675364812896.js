window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>How To Eat Loads and Stay Slim</i> isn’t a diet book. Not in the traditional sense. It’s a mixture of hard science (e.g. how hunger really works), quick ‘cheats’ (e.g. how to make zero fat chips), psychological techniques (e.g. why focusing on your food as you eat is really important), ingenious strategies (e.g. how to cut down on sugar without going cold turkey), and easy peasy recipes (e.g. Peter’s roast potato &amp; egg smashup breakfast or Della’s apple ginger clafouti) – all served up in an easy-to-digest, humorous listen from authors who’ve been where you are now. </p><p>Each of thought provoking, scientifically-provable, idea has a Star Rating. There are fifty four stars available. You get one just for buying the book! Collect enough and you’ll steadily increase your chances of being able to eat loads and stay slim. Collect enough stars (30 or more would be a good target to have) and we personally guarantee that a slim figure, coupled with a healthy but satiated appetite, are yours for the taking. No dieting required. </p>";
