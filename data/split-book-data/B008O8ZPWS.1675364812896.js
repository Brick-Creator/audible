window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Headlines scream across the nation, as a country in near panic pleads for the capture of the killers. With little progress, U.S. President Samuel Schroeder asks Jack McCall, a veteran of the CIA and Defense Intelligence, to head up a special multi-agency task force to find the killers. A frustrated and unhappy FBI designates, as its representative, Rachel Johnstone, an agent with whom Jack has had some personal history. </p> <p><i>The Third Coincidence</i> unfolds amidst continued assassinations, accusations that the president is attempting to form his own secret police, and confirmation hearings for reluctant nominees to fill the vacant positions while the Supreme Court struggles to sustain a quorum. Will a terrorist group or a mad assassin succeed in destroying these revered intuitions? </p> <p>In the spirit of <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> and <i>The Manchurian Candidate,</i> this story is juxtaposed through the eyes of both the hunter and the hunted as the devious plot to change America hurdles forward.</p>";
