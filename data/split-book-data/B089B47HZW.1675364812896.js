A shocking crime, with a meticulous killer: the victim’s eyes have been removed and the body drained of blood, with no forensic evidence left at the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Her boss insists it must be the return of a killer who escaped justice several years ago, leaving a trail of bloody ritualistic killings.
