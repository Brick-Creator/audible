window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A DS Glyn Capaldi Mystery.</p> <p>DS Glyn Capaldi is in hospital recuperating from concussion and the after-effects of a car crash. But, worse than that, a young woman is dead. She was the passenger in the car, whom he was bringing in for questioning following a night operation in a remote rural location. Glyn is initially riven with guilt and self-recrimination. Until he starts to question the possibility that it may not have been an accident.</p><p>But, if not, who had been the target? Had he made an enemy capable of achieving that level of planning and implementation? Or, if not him, what could a young woman have possibly done in her short country life to warrant that degree of retribution?</p><p>Glyn, on sick leave, has time on his hands to explore the background to these questions, and, in doing so, confronts a conspiracy that envelops arson, torture, blackmail, and leaves a clutter of bodies that further muddy the already murky waters.</p>";
