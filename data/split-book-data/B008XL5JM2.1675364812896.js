window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set in Nazi occupied Europe, <i>All My Love, Detrick</i> follows the lives of two families, one Jewish and one German. They are bound together forever by a forbidden love. </p> <p>Excerpt: The desolation all around her touched a nerve, and she hurried to turn the corner. A soft voice whispered in her mind, \"Hurry, Leah, it's not safe here.\" Her heart began to race. Sweat formed in her armpits. Now there were no more houses; only open field. Walking faster her heel hit a patch of ice. Stumbling and tripping she fell. Fortunately, she'd fallen to her left landing on a grassy surface. Nausea played havoc with her stomach as it accompanied the thumping of her heart in her eardrums. Something felt wrong. </p> <p>If you like historical sagas, you'll love <i>All My Love, Detrick.</i></p>";
