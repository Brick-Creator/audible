window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 2 in the ntionally best-selling Presidential Series by West Point graduate, former Green Beret and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Author Bob Mayer.</p> <p>What is the Sword of Damocles that President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev developed in secret during the dark days of the Cuban Missile Crisis? </p> <p>For 13 days in October 1963 the world came the closest to nuclear armageddon. On 22 November 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated. On the 25th of November, as Kennedy’s body lay in state at the Rotunda in Washington, Anastas Mikyoan, Khrushchev’s top adviser, presented the Premier’s condolences to Jacqueline Kennedy. She took Mikoyan’s hand in both hers and told him: \"I am sure that Chairman Khrushchev and my husband could have been successful in the search for peace, and they were really striving for that. Now the Chairman must continue the agreed upon endeavor and bring it to completion.\" </p> <p>On 12 October 1964, a Washington socialite named Mary Meyer was shot in the back of the head and through the heart at point-blank range. She had been married to a high-ranking CIA agent. More importantly, she had been carrying on an affair with President John F. Kennedy and was one of his most trusted friends, at his side through the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. </p> <p>Mary Meyer kept a secret diary. </p> <p>On 13 October 1964, the day after Mary Meyer’s murder, the Soviet Politburo forced Nikita Khrushchev to resign from power and put him under house arrest. </p> <p>What was in Mary Meyer’s diary that caused her murder and Khrushchev’s resignation? Why is it even more important today to find and decrypt it? </p> <p>Today, in the foothills of Mount Ararat an operative makes a chilling discovery: six Jupiter Missiles dating back to the Cuban Missile Crisis. But only three of the nuclear warheads are present. Where are the other three? </p> <p>Paul Ducharme and Evie Tolliver unveil a fail-safe type scenario brokered by President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev and race against time before the archaic Sword of Damocles initiates World War III. </p>";
