window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Robert Rodi’s follow-up to <i>The Sugarman Bootlegs</i> once again finds him mixing lethal social satire and nail-biting suspense, in the classic Alfred Hitchcock tradition. When financial collapse hits Marcus Hyde - a fussy, high-end art dealer - he’s forced to give up his spacious apartment and move in with his sister Pamela, who's large, slovenly, and titanically pregnant. </p> <p>But there’s worse in store for Marcus when Baby is born. He’s never seen anything more horrifying than this scarlet, steaming, shrieking lump of raw greed and unchecked will, with yellow eyes and fingernails like teeth. And when things start happening - terrible things; deadly things - Marcus alone understands why. And Marcus alone realizes that for his own safety and sanity…Baby must go. A wry, wicked tale of psychological (and biological) horror, <i>Baby</i> is endlessly addictive - a postmillennial mash-up of <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i> and <i>Psycho.</i> Hommages à Alfred is a series of novels inspired by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, incorporating mystery, menace, murder, and mordant wit. </p>";
