window.bookSummaryJSON = "In 1954, in the cookhouse of a logging and sawmill settlement in northern New Hampshire, an anxious 12-year-old boy mistakes the local constable's girlfriend for a bear. Both the 12-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto, pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them. <p>In a story spanning five decades, <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i> - John Irving's 12th novel - depicts the recent half-century in the United States as \"a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course\". </p> <p>From the novel's taut opening sentence - \"The young Canadian, who could not have been more than 15, had hesitated too long\" - to its elegiac final chapter, <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i> is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of <i>The Cider House Rules</i> and <i>A Prayer for Owen Meany</i>. It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving's breakthrough best seller <i>The World According to Garp</i>.</p> <p>What further distinguishes <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i> is the author's unmistakable voice - the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: \"We don't always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly - as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth - the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.\"</p>";
