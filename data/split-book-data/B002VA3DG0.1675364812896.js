window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Christopher Miller is up against a group of domestic terrorists who are copying Al Qaeda's tactics: operating in cells, following a twisted fundamentalist doctrine, targeting \"public amusements\". A White Supremacist hate group has smuggled in a stinger missile and recruited an army marksman: a nightmare vision of a new and more talented Timothy McVeigh. Their initial plan is to bring down an airliner as it takes off from JFK airport.</p> <p>When Miller warns authorities about this group and its plans, no one listens, because the FBI's focus has shifted to foreign terrorists, and his home, Jersey City, has the second largest population of Arab Muslims in America. \"Saint Chris\" comes up against the same sort of bureaucratic resistance encountered by the FBI agents who, pre-9/11, wrote memos about Arab Terrorists Flying Airplanes that no one paid attention to. The White Wolves have chosen Thanksgiving as the day to strike, since they feel the holiday commemorates God giving of this country to his chosen people: the white man. Meanwhile, on the home front, Miller has to cope with his daughter's post traumatic stress as the anniversary of her Christmas nightmare draws near and he will be torn between taking care of her and saving thousands of innocent lives!</p> <p>Don't miss Christopher Miller's first holiday adventure,<i> Slay Ride</i>.</p>";
