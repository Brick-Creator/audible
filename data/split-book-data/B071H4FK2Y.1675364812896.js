It is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliffside mansion on the Italian Riviera. During the restless summer weeks, unrelenting but buried currents of obsession, fascination, and desire intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them and verge toward the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy. André Aciman's critically acclaimed debut novel is a frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>More praise for</b> <b><i>Call Me By Your Name:</i></b></p> <p>\"Hammer’s soft, velvety voice lends itself perfectly to the story and its Italian setting. While you might think this one isn’t worth a listen if you’ve already seen the movie or read the book, many reviewers say it is still worth taking in even if you know the story - some even say it’s worth listening to more than once.\" (AskMen)</p>";
