window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>Kidnapped</i> has long been considered a masterpiece of high adventure. In <i>The Low Road,</i> James Lear reinvents this classic as a satirical, queer, coming-of-age story. </p> <p>In 1750 Scotland, young Charles Gordon reaches adulthood ignorant of his family's heroic past in the Jacobite Rebellion. He sets out to discover the truth about his father, but instead is kidnapped by mercenaries and sold into slavery as the plaything of a group of corrupt military officials. But Charlie's talents, in and out of bed, win him powerful friends as well as dangerous foes. The false priest, Lebecque, violent Captain Robert, depraved General Wilmott all contribute to Charlie's 'education'. Eventually leading a makeshift army of sex-crazed layabouts, Charlie faces the might of the English forces. Will he triumph, or is it better to retreat to the safety of his sybaritic lifestyle? </p> <p>James Lear expertly interweaves spies and counterspies, scheming servants and sadistic captains, tavern trysts and prison orgies, into this delightfully erotic work that can take its place alongside his acclaimed novels <i>The Back Passage</i> and <i>Hot Valley.</i></p>";
