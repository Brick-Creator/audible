window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David L. Robbins, author of the war classic <i>War of the Rats,</i> delivers another heart-stopping, deeply researched military adventure, this time right off today’s front pages. </p> <p>The US military’s most highly trained and elite unit is the US Air Force pararescuers, known as PJs. All battle-hardened vets, their motto is \"That Others May Live\". Their singular mission is CSAR: Combat Search and Rescue. But, off the Horn of Africa, one PJ unit is tasked with a desperate assignment that goes against its oath: Take down a cargo ship full of secrets that’s been captured by Somali pirates. The team doesn’t hesitate, because one of its own is already on board the hijacked ship. There, they will face ruthless Yusuf Raage, a pirate leader who will sacrifice anything and anyone to keep his captured ship. The PJs have only one hour before the ship is destroyed by a missile, with all hands and cargo aboard.</p>";
