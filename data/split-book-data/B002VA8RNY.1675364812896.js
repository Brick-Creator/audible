window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>The Pyramid</i> is the long-awaited addition to Henning Mankell's critically celebrated and internationally best-selling Kurt Wallander mystery series - a book of five short mysteries that takes us back to the beginning. Here are the stories that trace, chronologically, Wallander's growth from a rookie cop into a young father and then a middle-aged divorcé, illuminating how Wallander became a first-rate detective and highlighting new facets of a now canonical character. <p>Kenneth Branagh will play Kurt Wallander in a new PBS <i>Masterpiece Theatre Mystery!</i> series this summer.</p>";
