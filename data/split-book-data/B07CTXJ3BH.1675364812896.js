window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At last!</p> <p>Return to the world of Emma Jameson’s best-selling Blue series in audiobook five, <i>Blue Blooded</i>.</p> <p>Tony Hetheridge is stepping into a new career - private detective. As a chief superintendent for New Scotland Yard, he spent years presiding over the “Toff Squad”, handling murders that intersected with the rich and powerful. Now that mantle passes to his wife Kate, while Tony is free to pick and choose his cases. The first: the strange suicide of Mariah Keene and the simultaneous disappearance of her twin Mark. The 21-year-old twins were university dropouts, recreational drug users, and dabblers in the unusual spiritual discipline called sacred geometry. But those risk factors pale compare to their association with the unjustly acquitted triple murderer, Sir Duncan Godington.</p> <p>As Tony goes undercover in the City of Westminster to search for Mark and discover what really happened to Mariah, tempestuous Kate struggles to balance family life with work. She and Tony are determined to adopt nine-year-old Henry; her estranged sister, Maura, is suing to regain full custody. At Scotland Yard’s new HQ, her best mate Paul Bhar is being put out to pasture while Kate finds herself up for a long-sought promotion. And her first solo investigation, the high-tech murder of a politician, takes an unexpected turn toward Tony’s case - and Sir Duncan. Is it mere coincidence? Or has Sir Duncan’s reckoning come at last? <br> &nbsp;</p> <p>Emma Jameson's Blue Series <br> #1<i> Ice Blue </i><br> #2<i> Blue Murder </i><br> #3<i> Something Blue </i><br> #4<i> Black &amp; Blue </i><br> #5<i> Blue Blooded</i></p>";
