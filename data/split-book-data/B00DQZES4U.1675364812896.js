window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Patron saints, headlocks, thrash metal, crash diets, dogpiles, nutpulls and only the occasional assault. </p> <p>Set in Little Falls, New Jersey in 1993, <i>PINS</i> weaves the classic story of a Catholic saint into a compelling modern life - and near-death - account of Joey Nicci, a fifteen-year-old Italian-American wrestler. After befriending Donald \"Dink\" Kohrs, Joey and his new posse get involved in pranks and partying that eventually get out of control, resulting in the death of a maligned fellow teammate. </p> <p>The ensuing legal battle and media frenzy alter Joey's life and his self-perception as a gay teenager while shattering his fragile love for fellow teammate Dink. Like his patron saint, his battle against his own teammates forces him to suffer for his beliefs. His survival becomes a literary miracle. A compelling story of a loving yet confused family, coaches and teachers struggling with multiple issues of violence and homophobia amid the clan-like world of teenage athletes, <i>PINS</i> brings together elements now frighteningly common in the media: bullying jocks, assaults on weaker students, faculty and families unwittingly allowing such behavior. </p> <p>Called \"prescient\" and \"heartfelt\" by two of today's leading writers, <i>PINS</i> layers symbols from the worlds of animals and religion, yet while achieving a unique literary style, it remains accessible to the group for whom it speaks - gay teenagers.</p>";
