window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of <i>Words in the Dust</i>: an actionpacked YA novel set in a frighteningly plausible near future, about what happens when the States are no longer United. </p> <p>Danny Wright never thought he'd be the man to bring down the United States of America. In fact, he enrolled in the National Guard because he wanted to serve his country the way his father did. When the Guard is called up on the governor's orders to police a protest in Boise, it seems like a routine crowdcontrol mission... but then Danny's gun misfires, spooking the other soldiers and the already fractious crowd. By the time the smoke clears, 12 people are dead. The president wants the soldiers arrested. The governor swears to protect them. And as tensions build on both sides, the conflict slowly escalates toward the unthinkable: a second American civil war. </p> <p>With political questions that are popular in American culture yet rare in YA fiction, and a plot that's both excitingly provocative and frighteningly plausible, <i>Divided We Fall</i> will be Trent Reedy's very timely YA debut.</p>";
