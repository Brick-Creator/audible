window.bookSummaryJSON = "At turns shockingly fierce and surprisingly tender, <i>Goat</i> is a shattering memoir that graphically portrays the scarred emotional landscape of young men. Brad is driving two strangers home from a party when he realizes they are leading him to the middle of nowhere. Viciously beaten and left in the middle of the road, Brad survives. But as his physical injuries heal, his psychological wounds worsen. Desperate to belong, he pledges his brother's fraternity. What he finds is not brotherhood and support, but alienation and more violence.";
