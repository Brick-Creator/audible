window.bookSummaryJSON = "The story of <i>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</i> is very difficult to describe. Usually we give some information about the audiobook, but in this case we think that would spoil the listening. We think it's important that you start to listen without knowing what it is about. <p>If you do start to listen, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy named Bruno. (Though this isn't a story for nine-year-olds.) And sooner or later, you will arrive with Bruno at the fence.</p> <p>Fences like this exist all over the world. We hope that you never have to encounter such a fence.</p>";
