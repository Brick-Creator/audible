His naughty list is longer than ever.&nbsp;</p> <p>And it contains some worryingly familiar names....</p> <p><b><i>A Snowballâ€™s Chance in Hell</i></b><b> is the ninth book in the internationally best-selling DCI Jack Logan Scottish crime fiction series. Perfect for fans of Ian Rankin, Stuart Macbride, and Val McDermid.</b></p>";
