For Detective Inspector Louise Blackwell, recently transferred to the town she last saw as a child, it’s her first case on the job.</p> <p>The victim - Veronica Lloyd, an elderly volunteer at a local church - has puncture wounds to her hands. When a priest is found killed in a nearby church in a similarly grisly condition, it becomes clear that Blackwell is dealing with a righteous and bloody murderer. But the victims aren’t random. The killer has a vendetta and is hell-bent on exacting twisted revenge for a dark secret dating back years - and there are more murders planned.</p> <p>As the body count rises, Blackwell faces a race against time to solve the mystery of the murderer’s identity and put an end to the carnage. She thought she knew Weston, but the town holds more secrets than she’d ever have imagined. Who can she trust and who knows more than they are letting on?</p> <p>She must discover the crimes that unite the victims - before it’s too late.</p>";
