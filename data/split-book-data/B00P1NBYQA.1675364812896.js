window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A<i> New York Times </i>best-selling and widely admired Catholic writer explores how we can retrieve transcendent faith in modern times</b> </p> <p>Critically acclaimed and best-selling author James Carroll has explored every aspect of Christianity, faith, and Jesus Christ, except this central one: What can we believe about - and how can we believe in - Jesus in the 21st century in light of the atrocities of the 20th century and the drift from religion that followed? </p> <p>What Carroll has discovered through decades of writing and lecturing is that he is far from alone in clinging to a received memory of Jesus that separates him from his crucial identity as a Jew, and therefore as a human. Yet if Jesus were not taken as divine, he would be of no interest to us. What can that mean now? Paradoxically, the key is his permanent Jewishness. No Christian himself, Jesus actually transcends Christianity. </p> <p>Drawing on both a wide range of scholarship as well as his own acute searching as a believer, Carroll takes a fresh look at the most familiar narratives of all - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Not simply another book about the \"historical Jesus,\" he takes the challenges of science and contemporary philosophy seriously, even as he retrieves the power of Jesus' profound ordinariness, as an answer to his own last question - what is the future of Jesus Christ? - as the key to a renewal of faith. </p>";
