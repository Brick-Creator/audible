window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of the critically admired, award-winning <i>A Replacement Life</i> turns to a different kind of story - an evocative, nuanced portrait of marriage and family, a woman reckoning with what she's given up to make both work, and the universal question of how we reconcile who we are and whom the world wants us to be. </p> <p>Maya Shulman and Alex Rubin met in 1992, when she was a Ukrainian exchange student with \"a devil in [her] head\" about becoming a chef instead of a medical worker, and he was the coddled son of Russian immigrants wanting to toe the water of a less predictable life. </p> <p>Twenty years later Maya Rubin is a medical worker in suburban New Jersey, and Alex his father's second in the family business. The great dislocation of their lives is their eight-year-old son Max - adopted from two teenagers in Montana despite Alex's view that \"adopted children are second-class\". </p> <p>At once a salvation and a mystery to his parents - with whom Max's biological mother left the child with the cryptic exhortation \"don't let my baby do rodeo\" - Max suddenly turns feral, consorting with wild animals, eating grass, and running away to sit facedown in a river. </p> <p>Searching for answers, Maya convinces Alex to embark on a cross-country trip to Montana to track down Max's birth parents - the first drive west of New Jersey of their American lives. But it's Maya who's illuminated by the journey, her own erstwhile wildness summoned for a reckoning by the unsparing landscape, with seismic consequences for herself and her family. </p> <p><i>Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo</i> is a novel about the mystery of inheritance and what exactly it means to belong. </p>";
