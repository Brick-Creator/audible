window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Sometimes I’d see my father, walking past my building on his way to another nowhere. I could have given him a key, offered a piece of my floor. But if I let him inside the line between us would blur, my own slow-motion car wreck would speed up.”</p> <p>With a raw authenticity stripped of self-pity and a powerful narrative voice unlike any other, <i>Being Flynn</i> illuminates the hidden story of fathers and sons in America. Nick Flynn has written a remarkable testament to the enduring strength of one boy’s struggle for survival.</p> <p>Nick met his father when he was working as a caseworker in a homeless shelter in Boston. As a teenager, he’d received letters from this stranger, a self-proclaimed poet and con man doing time in federal prison for bank robbery. <i>Being Flynn</i> tells the story of the trajectory that led Nick and his father onto the streets, into that shelter, and finally, to each other.</p>";
