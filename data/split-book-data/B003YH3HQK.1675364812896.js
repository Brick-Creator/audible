window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>*Please note this audiobook contains explicit language.</b></p> <p><i>Nineteen Eighty</i> is set against an evolving backdrop of power, corruption, and lies.</p> <p>The nightmare continues during the winter of 1980 when the Ripper murders his 13th victim and the whole of Yorkshire is terrorised. Assistant Chief Constable Hunter struggles to solve the hellish crimes and bring an end to the horror, but is drawn ever deeper into a world of bent coppers and sleaze. After his house is burned down, his wife is threatened and his colleagues turn against him, Hunter’s quest becomes personal, as he has nothing left to lose.</p> <p><i>Nineteen Eighty</i> is a compelling battle between two desperate men, each determined to destroy the other. This third volume of the Red Riding Quartet displays Peace’s unique voice, which places him as one of the UK’s finest crime writers.</p> <p> David Peace (born 1967) is an English author. He was named one of the Best of Young British Novelists by <i>Granta</i> in 2003 and won the 2004 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction.
