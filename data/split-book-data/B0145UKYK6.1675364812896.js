window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first novel in the nationally best-selling McCabe and Savage series - perfect for fans of John Sandford and C. J. Box. </p> <p>Someone is stealing the hearts of beautiful women.... </p> <p>Detective Mike McCabe moved from a top homicide job with the NYPD to Portland, Maine, to leave his failed marriage and suspicions of wrongdoing behind, and to find a more peaceful life for himself and his 13-year-old daughter. </p> <p>But the small New England city is not nearly as safe as he thought. </p> <p>On a warm September night, a missing high school athlete is found dead in a scrap-metal yard, her heart removed from her body with surgical precision. As outrage over the killing spreads, a young businesswoman disappears while out on a morning jog. </p> <p>McCabe is certain both crimes are the work of one man - a murderer skilled in cardiac surgery who is using his scalpel to target young women. With the clock ticking, McCabe and his partner, Maggie Savage, find themselves in a desperate race against time to find and rescue the missing woman before she becomes the next victim of the sadistic killer's blade. </p>";
