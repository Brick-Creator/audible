window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Shandee finds a friendly arm at a granite quarry. Ned drops down a hole in a golf course. Luna meets a man made of light bulbs at a tanning parlor. So begins Nicholson Baker's fuse-blowing, sex-positive escapade, <i>House of Holes</i>. Baker, the best-selling author of <i>The Mezzanine</i>, <i>Vox</i>, and <i>The Fermata</i>, who \"writes like no one else in America\" (<i>Newsweek</i>), returns to erotic territory with a gleefully over-the-top novel set in a pleasure resort, where normal rules don't apply. Visitors, pulled in via their drinking straws or the dryers in laundromats, can undergo crotchal transfers... make love to trees... visit the Groanrooms and the 12-screen Porndecahedron... or pussy-surf the White Lake. It's very expensive, of course, but there are work-study programs. In charge of day-to-day operations is Lila, a former hospital administrator whose breast milk has unusual regenerative properties. </p> <p>Brimful of good-nature, wit, and surreal sexual vocabulary, <i>House of Holes</i> is a modern-day Hieronymous Boschian bacchanal that is sure to surprise, amuse, and arouse. </p>";
