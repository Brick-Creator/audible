window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Timson talks about Charles Dickens, much loved for his great contribution to classic English Literature. Listen to <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> narrated by Sean Barrett.</p><p>The Chuzzlewits are a family divided by money and selfishness; even young Martin, the eponymous hero, is arrogant and self-centred. He offends his grandfather by falling in love with the latter’s ward, Mary, and sets out to make his own fortune in life, travelling as far as America&nbsp;- which produces from Dickens a savage satire on a new world tainted with the vices of the old. Martin’s nature slowly changes through his bitter experience of life and his enduring love for Mary. <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> is one of Dickens’s most humorous and satirical novels, and it contains two great comic creations: the hypocrite Pecksniff and the drunken nurse Sarah Gamp.</p>";
