He’s moved back home to Faith, New Mexico, and taken a job as assistant sheriff. What he doesn’t realize is that his newest nightmare’s about to begin. Strange things are happening. People are disappearing, and for others, it’s far worse... </p> <p><b>Distance separates them</b> </p> <p>Miles away in Albuquerque, Kyle Bancroft’s life is spinning out of control. She’s seeing, hearing, and dreaming things she can’t explain: flashbacks to World War II and an eerie hospital ward with locked doors, empty gurneys, and guttural screams. To make matters worse, a ghostly green-eyed girl is complicating her visions with an urgent message: time is running out. </p> <p><b>A dark secret connects them</b> </p> <p>Kyle’s otherworldly encounters are driving her straight toward Faith...and right into Cameron’s life. The body count is rising, the pressure is mounting, and the clock is ticking as they rush to uncover a dangerous secret hiding just below the surface of this all-American town - one that’s threatening to destroy Faith and everyone in it. A secret they must hunt down quickly... even if it costs them their own lives. </p> <p>A voice from the grave will draw them together</p>";
