window.bookSummaryJSON = "When Navy SEAL Mack Bedford's fellow officers are brutally killed by Iraqi insurgents using a cruel, new anti-tank Diamondhead missile, Mack avenges their murders by gunning down the then-unarmed attackers, ultimately getting himself court-martialed and kicked out of the Navy. To make matters worse, Mack then learns that the Diamondhead missiles were sold illegally by French industrialist and infamous politician Henri Foche. Mack believes Foche will become the next French President, and fears that his election will result in the cancellation of all navy-ship purchases from the United States, and thus protect French interests in the Diamondhead. End result: doom for Mack's hometown shipbuilding yard and the spread of international terrorism.";
