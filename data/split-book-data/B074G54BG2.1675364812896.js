window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of <i>A Boy Called Christmas</i> comes a hilarious and heartwarming holiday tale for fans of Roald Dahl and Charles Dickens' <i>A Christmas Carol</i> that imagines the story of the first child to ever receive a Christmas present.</b> </p> <p>Amelia Wishart was the first child ever to receive a Christmas present. It was <i>her</i> Christmas spirit that gave Santa the extra boost of magic he needed to make his first trip around the world. But now Amelia is in trouble. </p> <p>When her mother falls ill, she is sent to the workhouse to toil under cruel Mr. Creeper. For a whole year, Amelia scrubs the floors and eats watery gruel without a whiff of kindness to keep her going. It's not long before her hope begins to drain away. </p> <p>Meanwhile, up at the North Pole, magic levels dip dangerously low as Christmas approaches, and Santa knows that something is gravely wrong. With the help of his trusty reindeer, a curious cat, and Charles Dickens, he sets out to find Amelia, the only girl who might be able to save Christmas. But first, Amelia must learn to believe again.... </p>";
