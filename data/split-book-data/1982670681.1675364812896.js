window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Thomas Prescott returns in a smoldering thriller of murder, treachery, and revenge. His love life in shambles, retired homicide detective Thomas Prescott returns to Seattle, the very place he fled from after his parents’ deaths nearly a decade earlier. Just as Prescott is getting settled in, he sees a body floating in the private cove behind his boyhood home. It’s a woman. But not just any woman. It’s Ellen Gray - the governor of Washington - who has been missing for the past six weeks.</p> <p>The lead suspect in the governor’s murder is her husband, famed defense attorney, Adam Gray. But unlike the Seattle Police Department - where Thomas was fired from several years earlier - Prescott has his doubts about Adam’s guilt. Ignoring direct orders to stay away from the case, Prescott soon finds himself drawn into the heart of the investigation.&nbsp;Working side-by-side with SPD detective, Erica Frost, Prescott uncovers a sophisticated conspiracy linked to a new breed of killer. In his pursuit to catch a madman, Prescott’s investigation will take him from the state capital to the snow-covered peaks of the North Cascades and for the first time in his career, Thomas finds himself both the hunter...and the hunted.</p>";
