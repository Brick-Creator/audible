window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his three novellas, <i>In Short Measures</i>, <i>Strong Conspirators</i>, and <i>Sally Forth</i>, Michael Ruhlman delves deeply into the nuanced complexity of romantic and sexual love - and the inevitable evolution of the heart over the span of years and decades. Each novella asks questions about the nature of love in terms of loyalty and fidelity - what are one's obligations toward one's spouse, one's family, and one's heart? </p><p>In the first novella, <i>In Short Measures</i>, these questions are bound up in a writer's work and a long-ago love. In the second, <i>Strong Conspirators</i>, an unforeseen, cataclysmic event calls for responses from a husband and wife that have never been rehearsed because they have never been required nor even imagined. In <i>Sally Forth</i>, a pair of old friends is forced to explore lost youth and lost love relative to maturity, marriage, and the passage of time. </p><p>Profoundly thought provoking and satisfying, these novellas are beautifully written, with plot twists from beginning to end that will captivate the listener. </p>";
