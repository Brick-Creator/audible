window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Who are you? What defines you? What is your identity?</b> </p> <p>How you answer those questions affects every aspect of your life: personal, public, and spiritual. So it's vital to get the answer right. </p> <p>Pastor and best-selling author Mark Driscoll believes false identity is at the heart of many struggles - and that you can overcome them by having your true identity in Christ. In <i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i> Driscoll explores the question: \"What does it mean to be 'in Christ'?\" In the process he dissects the false-identity epidemic and, more important, provides the only solution - Jesus.</p>";
