With her husband's memory fading, Ann attempts to piece together the truth of what happened to Wade's first wife, Jenny, and to their daughters. In a story written in exquisite prose and told from multiple perspectives - including Ann, Wade, and Jenny, now in prison - we gradually learn of the mysterious and shocking act that fractured Wade and Jenny's lives, of the love and compassion that brought Ann and Wade together, and of the memories that reverberate through the lives of every character in <i>Idaho</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a wild emotional and physical landscape, Wade's past becomes the center of Ann's imagination, as Ann becomes determined to understand the family she never knew - and to take responsibility for them, reassembling their lives - and her own.</p> <p><b>Finalist for:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><b>International Dylan Thomas Prize</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li><b>Edgar First Novel Award</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li><b>Young Lions Fiction Award </b></li> </ul> <p>“You know you’re in masterly hands here.

[A] wrenching and beautiful book.” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Editors’ Choice)</p> <p>“Sensuous, exquisitely crafted.” (<i>The&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</i>)</p> <p>“The first thing you should know about&nbsp;<i>Idaho</i>,&nbsp;the shatteringly original debut by O. Henry Prize winner Emily Ruskovich, is that it upturns everything you think you know about story.... You could read<i>&nbsp;Idaho</i>&nbsp;just for the sheer beauty of the prose, the expert way Ruskovich makes everything strange and yet absolutely familiar.” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>“Mesmerizing...[an] eerie story about what the heart is capable of fathoming and what the hand is capable of executing.” (<i>Marie Claire</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>“<i>Idaho</i>&nbsp;is a wonderful debut.
