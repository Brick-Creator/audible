Had he put too much emphasis on work and spent too little time with his family? </p> <p>Determined to leave something far more valuable than money to his six children, Paul instructs his lawyers to create an unusual last will and testament. This unorthodox will, which stipulates that the lion's share of Paul's two-billion-dollar estate be given to the heirs who pass \"the test\", was Paul's last hope of creating a lasting legacy by inspiring his children to give back to society and embrace a code of moral values. </p> <p>The six children - Rory, Frank, Dan, Monica, Carl, and Ashley - have only one year to make a difference. But what a difference one year will make. </p> <p>Before these six very different siblings can complete the test, they'll be forced to face their personal demons, and the incredibly evil influence that could claim one of their own.</p>";
