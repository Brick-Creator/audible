window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Move over, Scarlett O'Hara! It's New England, 1861, and the troubles in the southern states seem a long way off for Jack Edgerton, the spoiled son of a prominent Vermont family. Howver, when he meets and falls in love with Aaron Johnson, the sexy son of a slave on the run from Virginia, Edgerton's world is turned upside down. </p> <p>Separated by circumstances, the lovers pursue each other through the escalating madness of the Civil War and both find themselves forced to choose sides. After a series of outrageous adventures - including steamy woodland trysts and an impromptu jailhouse orgy that briefly reconciles the warring parties - they are reunited in the Shenandoah Valley in the autumn of 1864 - where the conflict is about to come to a bloody, burning climax.</p>";
