window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"When you’re in the middle of the adventure, you just have to live it. When you’re on an expedition, you put your head down and battle through. Storytelling happens after the finish line... now that time has come [and] Julia can tell her story. The full story.\" (From the foreword by Bear Grylls.) </p> <p>An incredible account of one woman’s record-breaking row across the Atlantic. Thirty-two-year-old Julia Immonen and four other women take on a challenge completed by fewer people than have climbed Mount Everest or gone into space: row 3000 miles, unaided, from the Canary Islands to Barbados. <i>Row for Freedom</i> chronicles that dramatic journey, detailing the grueling, peril-filled crossing, which broke two world records, as it weaves together Julia’s search for hope and purpose against a background of relationships scarred by violence. As Julia’s physical and emotional treks unfold, you also learn about the plight of the 30 million victims of the modern-day slave trade that serves as the motivation for her row. Be inspired by Julia’s self-discovery and her team’s triumph in one of the most formidable physical quests ever undertaken. </p>";
