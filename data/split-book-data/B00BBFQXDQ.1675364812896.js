window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"If there were a Guinness Book of World Records entry for ‘amount of times having prayed the sinner’s prayer’, I’m pretty sure I’d be a top contender,\" says pastor and author J. D. Greear. He struggled for many years to gain an assurance of salvation and eventually learned he was not alone. \"Lack of assurance\" is epidemic among evangelical Christians. </p> <p>In <i>Stop Asking Jesus Into Your Heart,</i> J. D. shows that faulty ways of presenting the gospel are a leading source of the confusion. Our presentations may not be heretical, but they are sometimes misleading. The idea of \"asking Jesus into your heart\" or \"giving your life to Jesus\" often gives false assurance to those who are not saved - and keeps those who genuinely are saved from fully embracing that reality. </p> <p>Greear unpacks the doctrine of assurance, showing that salvation is a posture we take to the promise of God in Christ, a posture that begins at a certain point and is maintained for the rest of our lives. He also answers the tough questions about assurance: What exactly is faith? What is repentance? Why are there so many warnings that seem to imply we can lose our salvation?</p>";
