window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Fallen Land</i> is Taylor Brown's debut audiobook, set in the final year of the Civil War, as a young couple on horseback flees a dangerous band of marauders who seek a bounty reward. </p> <p>Callum, a seasoned horse thief at 15 years old, came to America from his native Ireland as an orphan. Ava, her father and brother lost to the war, hides in her crumbling home until Callum determines to rescue her from the bands of hungry soldiers pillaging the land, leaving destruction in their wake. Ava and Callum have only each other in the world and their remarkable horse, Reiver, who carries them through the destruction that is the South. </p> <p>Pursued relentlessly by a murderous slave hunter, tracking dogs, and ruthless ex-partisan rangers, the couple race through a beautiful but ruined land, surviving on food they glean from abandoned farms and the occasional kindness of strangers. In the end, as they intersect with the scorching destruction of Sherman's March, the couple seek a safe haven where they can make a home and begin to rebuild their lives. </p> <p>Dramatic and thrillingly narrated, <i>Fallen Land</i> is a love story at its core. With an uncanny eye for glimpses of beauty in a ravaged landscape, award-winning young author Taylor Brown delivers an unusually assured debut. </p>";
