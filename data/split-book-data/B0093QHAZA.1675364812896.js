window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Colin Dexter’s Chief Inspector Morse - the cranky, heavy-drinking, and exasperatingly brilliant sleuth of the Thames Valley Police - has become one of the most beloved detectives in fiction. Now, with this collection of 11 short stories, we can savor choice examples of his dry wit, devious cunning, and psychological insight at its best. </p> <p>Colin Dexter tantalizes us with six Inspector Morse adventures, ranging from bite-size morsels of intrigue to longer stories for listeners to sink their teeth into. Then, for added variety, Dexter shows his range with five mysteries featuring new characters and some familiar ones: one story features that other great English detective, Sherlock Holmes, in a tale that rivals those of Conan Doyle himself. “Morse’s Greatest Mystery” and the other stories in this collection are a banquet for the mystery lover - rich, varied, and satisfying. </p> <p>Stories included are: </p> <ul> <li>\"As Good as Gold\" </li> <li>\"Morse’s Greatest Mystery\" </li> <li>\"Evans Tries an O-Level\" </li> <li>\"Dead as a Dodo\" </li> <li>\"At the Lulu-Bar Motel\" </li> <li>\"Neighbourhood Watch\" </li> <li>\"A Case of Mis-identity\" </li> <li>\"The Inside Story\" </li> <li>\"Monty’s Revolver\" </li> <li>\"The Carpet-Bagger\" </li> <li>\"Last Call\" </li> </ul>";
