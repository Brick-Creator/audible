window.bookSummaryJSON = "One of Faulkner's comic masterpieces, <i>The Reivers</i> is a picaresque story that tells of three unlikely car thieves from rural Mississippi. Eleven-year-old Lucas Priest is persuaded by Boon Hogganbeck, one of his family's retainers, to steal his grandfather's car and make a trip to Memphis. The priests' black coachman, Ned McCaslin, stows away, and the three of them are off on a heroic odyssey, for which they are ill-equipped, that ends at Miss Reba's bordello in Memphis. From there, a series of wild misadventures ensues - involving horse smuggling, trainmen, sheriff's deputies, and jail.";
