window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Seven stories and a novella from a master author of the American West.</b> </p><p>Dolores and her mother have not seen Doloresâ€™s daddy for five days. Dolores - whom daddy calls Sugargirl - leaps to greet him when she hears his heavy steps on the front porch. Daddy is drunk, battered, and smells of cheap perfume; his return is cut short when Momma chases him out of the house with a hot iron. A few years later, when Momma is dead and Daddy is serving a 30-to-life stint in the state penitentiary, Dolores gets a letter addressed to Sugargirl. She is 16, on her own, and life will not get easier from here. </p><p>This novella and the seven accompanying stories represent the finest short fiction of celebrated western author James Carlos Blake. These tales span centuries and continents, but the characters share a common trait: They are citizens of the borderlands, from whence death is the only escape.</p>";
