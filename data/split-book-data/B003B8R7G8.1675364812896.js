window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Be inspired by saints like never before in <i>My Life with the Saints</i> by James Martin, SJ. This best-selling memoir of spiritual self-discovery is an homage to the saints who have accompanied Fr. Martin throughout his life. From a lukewarm childhood Catholicism, to the Wharton School of Business, to the executive fast track at General Electric, to the Jesuits, to a media career in Manhattan, Martin has relied on the saints to intervene in and guide his life. </p> <p>As Martin shares with us his many surprising encounters and journeys with the saints, he convincingly explains how we, too, can be close friends with the saints.</p>";
