window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With enormous heart and dazzling agility, Amy Franklin-Willis expertly mines the fault lines in one Southern working-class family. Driven by the soulful voices of 42-year-old Ezekiel Cooper and his mother, Lillian, <i>The Lost Saints of Tennessee</i> journeys from the 1940s to 1980s as it follows Zeke's evolution from anointed son to honorable sibling to unhinged middle-aged man. </p><p>After Zeke loses his twin brother in a mysterious drowning and his wife to divorce, only ghosts remain in his hometown of Clayton, Tennessee. Zeke makes the decision to leave town in a final attempt to escape his pain, throwing his two treasured possessions - a copy of <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry</i> Finn and his dead brother's ancient dog - into his truck and heading east. He leaves behind two young daughters and his estranged mother, who reveals her own conflicting view of the Cooper family story in a vulnerable but spirited voice stricken by guilt over old sins and clinging to the hope that her family isn't beyond repair. </p><p>When Zeke finds refuge with cousins in Virginia horse country, divine acts in the form of severe weather, illness, and a new romance collide, leading Zeke to a crossroads where he must decide the fate of his family. </p>";
