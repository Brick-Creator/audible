window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Scott Pomfret serves as a lector at St. Anthony Shrine in Boston. He also writes gay porn. His boyfriend is a flaming atheist, and his boyfriendâ€™s Protestant grandmother counts Catholicism as a sin worse than sodomy. From Pentecost to Pride, from the books of the Bible to the articles of <i>The Advocate,</i> Pomfret's wry, hysterically funny memoir maps with matchless humor the full spectrum of the gay Catholic experience. </p><p>Listen in as Pomfret learns a thing or two about love and compassion from Father Bear Daddy, a priest with a hot Gay.com profile, and the Three Hail Marys, and join him as he sets out on a brave quest to convince his archnemesis, Cardinal OMalley, to invite him to serve at a weekly mass.</p>";
