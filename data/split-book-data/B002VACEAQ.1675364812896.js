From vast plantations to the cramped closets of the Underground Railroad, it follows one young woman's inspiring journey of risk and sacrifice. <p>Caroline Fletcher, the daughter of a wealthy family in Richmond, has never questioned her father's right to own slaves. But after a lengthy visit to her uncle's home in Boston, she learns of the abolitionist movement. Now, knowing that slavery is against God's will, she must risk betraying the people she loves to obey her convictions.</p> <p>Compelling characters and the searing conflicts between North and South create a vivid canvas for Caroline's struggle to make the right decisions. Through Christina Moore's hearfelt narration, <i>Candle in the Darkness</i> burns even brighter.</p>";
