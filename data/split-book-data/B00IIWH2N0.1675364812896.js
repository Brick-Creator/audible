Yeah, maybe he brought the waitress home for some fun-he was too drunk to remember it-but he knows for a fact that he didn't kill her. He's an agent with the Office of Preternatural Affairs. He doesn't hurt people. He saves them.</p> <p>The cops disagree. Now Cèsar is running.</p> <p>Isobel Stonecrow speaks with the dead. She brings closure to the bereaved and heals broken hearts. But when she talks to the wrong spirit, the OPA puts a bounty on her head.</p> <p>Tracking down Isobel is the last case assigned to Cèsar before he bolts. If he finds her, he can prove that he didn't kill that waitress. He can clear his name, get his job back, and bring justice to all those wronged families. She's just one witch.</p> <p>He's bagged a dozen witches before. How hard can one more be?</p>";
