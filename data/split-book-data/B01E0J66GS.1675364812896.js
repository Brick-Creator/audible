window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, according to an Institute of Medicine report released in 2011. For many, chronic pain is part of an autoimmune disease, but all too often doctors turn to the same solution: painkilling drugs. </p> <p>But all of this medication simply isn't helping. As Dr. Peter Osborne, the leading authority on gluten sensitivity and food allergies, has found, the real solution often lies in what you eat. </p> <p>In <i>No Grain, No Pain</i>, Dr. Osborne shows how grains wreak havoc on the body by causing tissue inflammation, creating vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies, and triggering an autoimmune response that causes the body to attack itself. But he also offers practical steps to find relief. Using his drug-free, easy-to-implement plan, you will be able to eliminate all sources of gluten and gluten-like substances, experience significant improvement in 15 days, and eliminate pain within 30 days. </p>";
