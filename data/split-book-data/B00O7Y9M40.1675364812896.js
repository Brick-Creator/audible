window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>American hero Louis Zamperini shares his wisdom, values, lessons, secrets, and other insights gleaned from his remarkable experiences in this powerful and inspiring book. </p> <p>Louis Zamperini's struggle to survive the unimaginable - brought to life in his autobiography <i>Devil at My Heels</i> and in Laura Hillenbrand's number one <i>New York Times</i> best-seller and its film adaptation, <i>Unbroken</i> - elevated him to his rightful place among our country's greatest heroes. Now, Zamperini reveals the wisdom he learned along his incredible journey. </p> <p>Faced with one misfortune after another - a plane crash, the shark-filled waters of the Pacific, a brutal Japanese prisoner of war camp - Zamperini could have given up a thousand times. Instead, he chose to see every hardship as a challenge that he was determined to overcome. Enduring the perils of World War II, Zamperini continued to find adventure at every turn - from crashing weddings to facing down Frank Sinatra in a fight to getting mixed up in a bank robbery. Until his death at 97 he remained undaunted; happy, sharp-minded, and healthy, and continued to engage life to its fullest. </p> <p>In <i>Don't Give Up, Donâ€™t Give In</i>, he offers never-before told tales that embody his simple, yet essential secrets of success: how his relationship with God, his ever-positive attitude, his constant pursuit of accomplishment - and a healthy dose of mischief - have helped him lead a long and fulfilled life, lessons we can all use to transform our own.</p>";
