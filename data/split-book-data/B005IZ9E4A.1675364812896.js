window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first new collection of essays by Christopher Hitchens since 2004, <i>Arguably</i> offers an indispensable key to understanding the passionate and skeptical spirit of one of our most dazzling writers, widely admired for the clarity of his style, a result of his disciplined and candid thinking. Topics range from ruminations on why Charles Dickens was among the best of writers and the worst of men to the haunting science fiction of J.G. Ballard; from the enduring legacies of Thomas Jefferson and George Orwell to the persistent agonies of anti-Semitism and jihad. </p> <p>Hitchens even looks at the recent financial crisis and argues for the enduring relevance of Karl Marx. The book forms a bridge between the two parallel enterprises of culture and politics. It reveals how politics justifies itself by culture, and how the latter prompts the former. In this fashion, <i>Arguably</i> burnishes Christopher Hitchens' credentials as - to quote Christopher Buckley - our \"greatest living essayist in the English language.\"</p>";
