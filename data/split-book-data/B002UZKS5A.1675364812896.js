window.bookSummaryJSON = "Few recent thriller writers have elicited the kind of critical praise that Daniel Silva has received, with his \"provocative and deeply satisfying\" ( <i>The Miami Herald</i>) novels featuring art restorer and sometime spy Gabriel Allon, \"a man whose depth and passion make him one of the most fascinating characters in the genre\" ( <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>) <p>Now Allon is back in Venice, when a terrible explosion in Rome leads to a disturbing personal revelation: the existence of a dossier in terrorist hands that strips away his secrets, lays bare his history. Hastily recalled home to Israel, drawn once more into the heart of a service he had once forsaken, Allon finds himself stalking an elusive master terrorist across a landscape drenched with generations of blood, the trail turning on itself until, finally, he can no longer be certain who is stalking whom.</p> <p>And when at last the showdown comes, it will not be Gabriel alone who is threatened with destruction - for it is not his history alone that has been laid bare.</p> <p>A knife-edged thriller of astonishing intricacy and feeling, filled with exhilarating prose, this is Daniel Silva's finest novel yet.</p>";
