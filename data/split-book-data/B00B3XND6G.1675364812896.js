window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Winner, Inspirational/Faith-Based Fiction, 2014</b></p> <p><b>Based on the epic miniseries...</b> </p> <p><i>A Story of God and All of Us</i> is a sweeping narrative that dramatizes some of the most important events and characters in the Bible. The book is narrated like a fine novel, dramatizing the sweep of biblical events, making the men and women of scripture come alive in vivid detail and dialogue. All are historically and theologically accurate. A 10-hour miniseries on the History Channel will be based on the story, and the script has been reviewed by a number of Christian church leaders and seminarians for authenticity. The book will be released one month prior to the debut of the television series. Many prominent biblical characters will be dramatized in the story: Moses, David, Daniel, John the Baptist and, of course, Jesus. The book will reveal the prophetic significance of the empires that controlled Israel: (Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians and Romans) and how these figured into biblical prophecy, especially concerning the Messiah.</p>";
