And the sudden reappearance of the Garden of Eden is definitely one such situation, since the seemingly benevolent Sons of Adam want him to find the Key to the Gates of Eden. But there are those who want the Gates to stay shut, for there is something terrible and dangerous buried in the Garden . . .Caught between two warring factions of immortals, Remy must decide how to proceed: Find the Key, or not? Desperate for help, he turns to a very old acquaintance - a fallen angel who is sometimes friend, sometimes foe, and always deadly. </p>";
