window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Performed by Reese Witherspoon</b></p> <p><b>Number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller</b></p> <p><b>“</b><b><i>Go Set a Watchman</i></b><b> is such an important book, perhaps the most important novel on race to come out of the white South in decades.\" (</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>A landmark novel by Harper Lee, set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, </b><b><i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch - “Scout” - returns home to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise’s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past - a journey that can only be guided by one’s own conscience.&nbsp;</p> <p>Written in the mid-1950s, <i>Go Set a Watchman</i> imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of the late Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision - a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times.&nbsp;</p> <p>It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context, and new meaning to an American classic.&nbsp;</p>";
