window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sebastian Black is gorgeous and charismatic - and he’s telepathic. So when his prophetess mother, Kitty Black, declares him \"New Man\", their tiny spiritual movement mushrooms. But when disciples die and Christian militants declare war on this \"false messiah\", Sebastian runs, seeking refuge. </p> <p>On his journey, he meets \"common\" people with unforgettable histories: an aging lesbian couple; a Mexican handyman; an anorexic woman; a meth addict; a gay teenager; an unthinking college jock. As Sebastian’s understanding of life deepens, he drifts further from Kitty, who begins a plot to reel him back by conspiring with his enemies: followers of a dashing Spaniard who darkly mirrors Sebastian’s preternatural talents and beauty. But even Sebastian can’t foresee what happens next.... </p> <p>From Century City’s penthouses to Big Sur’s savage coastline, <i>Black as Snow</i> twists the fairytale of Snow White into a suspense-filled story of intrigue, spirituality, and greed - and the unyielding power of everyday love.</p>";
