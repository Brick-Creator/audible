window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It starts with a thunderous crack and a flash of light. Screams come next. Then the hunters. With a staccato flicker, light disappears and everything within a hundred-yard radius goes with it. All that remains is a massive crater where a chunk of the world has gone missing. As the deadly phenomenon repeats and expands amidst the world's most densely populated cities, Jack Sigler, Callsign: King, and his black ops team take action. But the team is broken, spread across the globe, and vulnerable. </p> <p>Scrambling to make sense of the violent disappearances and fighting to reunite, the team comes face to face with an otherworldly enemy. Taking the battle to the ends of the Earth - and beyond - the team combats a savage enemy whose centuries-old plan for mankind has nearly reached fruition. If they fail, the planet will become little more than a fully stocked food cache.</p>";
