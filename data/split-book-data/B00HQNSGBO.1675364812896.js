window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We can do more with this life. We all know it, we all wish for it, but just how to do itthat eludes us. In his new book, <i>A Life Worth Breathing</i>, internationally renowned yoga teacher and spiritual philosopher Max Strom shows us the way. His groundbreaking book reaches past expected dogma in a language that is vital, inspired, and accessible. Strom leads us on a journey of self-discovery as we excavate our past in order to have a better understanding of our present. </p> <p>According to Max Strom, We live in fear of terrorism but in actuality the most devastating terrorism comes from within us as we sabotage ourselves.” With practical techniques, <i>A Life Worth Breathing</i> offers us a path to transformation with visionary insights on forgiveness, gratitude and self-empowerment. The teachings are rooted in Yoga, Sufism and Eastern philosophy, but make no mistake, this is not just another yoga book of postures, it is a guidebook for living. </p> <p><i>A Life Worth Breathing</i> teaches us that by healing our past emotional wounds, silencing the inner critic that cripples us, and cultivating a yoga and breathing practice, we can elevate ourselves from the mindset of a reactionary victim to a higher level of awareness and empowerment. With these life skills we can achieve our true destiny, that of a fully integrated soul living an authentic life of meaning, success and joy. A life worth living, a life worth breathing. </p>";
