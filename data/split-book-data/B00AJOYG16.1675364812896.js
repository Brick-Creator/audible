window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This astonishing novel begins in 1907, when Josef Siedler, a science-fiction devotee, ventures deep into a series of caves in search of an entrance to the underworld. Disappointed in his quest, he nonetheless returns with a peculiar souvenir: a small rock sample that emits a strange humming sound. Upon Siedlerâ€™s death, the rock is bequeathed to his nephew, a significant step in what will become an extraordinary journey through the arc of history. For as the stone passes through the hands of a series of owners, we are told their stories: from pre-World War I ambitions and inter-war anarchism to conditions during World War II, the bleakness of life in postwar East Germany, the German art scene of the 1960s, and more. </p> <p>These snapshots of the 20th century serve to chronicle the continuity of humanity, with all its strengths and weaknesses. In <i>The Brummstein,</i> Danish author Peter Adolphsen has spun a mystical - and movingly memorable - exploration of the meaning of life.</p>";
