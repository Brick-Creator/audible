window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Let It Be</i> is an extraordinary story inspired by the music of The Beatles. </p> <p> Newly-separated Michelle Jansen longs to create a new life for herself and her children, Joseph and Pam, but making a fresh start isn't easy. A fresh start means upheaval - uprooting her family, moving across the state of Texas, settling into a too-small home, and entering the workforce - giving up the family's old life in search of something new and better. But even in the midst of chaos, Michelle experiences an awakening: she rediscovers her love of The Beatles and finds solace in the <i>Let It Be</i> album. She joins, and adapts to, the workplace, and she finds promise in a burgeoning relationship with a man who loves her without trying to control her. </p> <p> Soon, however, Michelle realizes that her overbearing ex-husband is willing to destroy her new life if he can't have her to himself. Given the past, her ex's behavior is no real surprise, but when she is betrayed by her own son, Michelle is hurt in an unexpected, almost unimaginable way. </p> <p> When passion and rage collide, one man will nearly lose his life, one will lose his freedom, and one family will never be the same. Can this fractured family find healing and forgiveness in the midst of guilt and sorrow? Or will love give them the strength to let it be? </p> <p> A powerful story of loss, longing, and forgiveness that unfolds under West Texas skies, <i>Let It Be</i> is a mesmerizing debut novel. Part family saga, part coming-of-age tale, part testament to the power of a mother's love, <i>Let It Be</i> chronicles the breakup of a marriage, the destruction of a family, and the struggle to come together in the aftermath of what remains.</p>";
