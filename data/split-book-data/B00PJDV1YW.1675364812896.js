window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Could we be living in a time of which there is more prophetic writings than of any period in history? Noah Parker, like many in the United States, has been asleep at the wheel. During his complacency, the founding precepts of America have been slowly, systematically destroyed by a conspiracy that dates back hundreds of years. The signs can no longer be ignored and Noah is forced to pull his head out of the sand and see things for what they really are. Has his awakening come too late or can he and those around him reclaim the freedoms and principles which have been lost? Watch through the eyes of Noah Parker and his family as a global empire takes shape, ancient writings are fulfilled and the last days fall upon the once great, United States of America. <i>The Days of Noah, Book One: Conspiracy</i> is a fast paced fiction thriller which looks at how modern conspiracies might play into Biblical prophecy about the end times.</p>";
