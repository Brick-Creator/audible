Can Drake catch a murderer trusted by everyone? </b></p> <p>When 89-year-old Emyr Isaac is found dead in his home, Drake and his team initially suspect a burglary gone wrong. Isaac was old, and his death was a tragedy, but it’s not a murder case...is it?&nbsp;</p> <p>But as the investigation develops, Drake uncovers more suspicious deaths - all elderly victims, all seemingly innocent - but with one connection: Each victim received care from the same healthcare professional during their last moments.</p> <p>If Drake’s suspicions are correct, they have a dangerous serial killer on the loose - someone who should offer help and safety, not a chilling early demise. Soon, the team realize that stopping this killer will require playing a dangerous game. Drake must do all he can to ensure no more lives are lost...even if it means putting members of his own team in harm’s way.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>A Cold Dark Heart </i>is the eighth book in the dynamic Inspector Drake crime series.
