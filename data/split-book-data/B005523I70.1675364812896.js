window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>TERRIFIED...</b></p> <p>It was supposed to be a harmless camping trip. Six wayward teenagers who'd run into trouble with the law, and their court-appointed guardians, Sara and Martin Randhurst. Three nights on a small, deserted island off of Michigan's upper peninsula. A time to bond, to learn, to heal.</p> <p>Then Martin told a campfire story about the island's history. Of the old civil war prison hidden in there, and the starving confederate soldiers who resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. Everyone thought it was funny. They even laughed when Martin pretended to be dragged off into the woods.</p> <p>But Martin didn't come back. And neither did Sara when she went in search of him.</p> <p>Then the laughter stopped.</p> <p><b>...TO DEATH</b></p> <p>The group soon began to realize that this deserted island wasn't so deserted after all. And perhaps Martin's ridiculous story had more truth to it than anyone thought.</p> <p>What's the most horrifying thing you can imagine?</p> <p>This is a hundred times worse...</p> <p><i>TRAPPED</i> by Jack Kilborn<br><i>It starts where other horror ends </i></p> <p><b><i>A Word of Warning</i></b></p> <p>This is the long-awaited follow-up to <i>AFRAID</i>, one of the most horrifying books ever written.</p> <p>Originally scheduled to be released in paperback in 2010, the publisher read the first version of the manuscript and refused to release it. The author made extensive changes, rewriting much of the story. The publisher still refused.</p> <p>This is a disturbing, terrifying book. You may think you're brave enough to handle it. But you're probably not...</p>";
