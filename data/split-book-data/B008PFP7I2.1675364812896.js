window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A veritable \"TKO of terminology\", <i>Better Than Great</i> is the essential guide for describing the extraordinary - the must-have reference for anyone wishing to rise above tired superlatives. Deft praise encourages others to feel as we do, share our enthusiasms. It rewards deserving objects of admiration. It persuades people to take certain actions. It sells things. Sadly, in this \"age of awesome\", our words and phrases of acclaim are exhausted, all but impotent. Even so, we find ourselves defaulting to such habitual choices as \"good\", \"great\", and \"terrific\", or stock synonyms that tumble out of a thesaurus - \"superb\", \"marvelous\", \"outstanding\", and the like. The piling on of intensifiers such as \"totally\" only makes matters worse, while negative modifiers (\"incredible\", \"unreal\") render our common parlance nearly tragic. Until now. </p> <p>Not to mince words, wunderkind of word-wonks Arthur Plotnik is proffering a well-knit wellspring of worthy and wondrous words to rescue our worn-down usage. Plotnik is both hella AND hecka up to the task of rescuing the English superlative, offering readers the chance never to be at a loss for words of praise and acclamation!</p>";
