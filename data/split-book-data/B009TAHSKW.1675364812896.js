window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number-one best seller</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The author spent 10 years inside the most violent prisons in California on drug charges. <i>Lock Up Diaries</i> is a depiction of life inside prison and a look at the political landscape between races and gangs. The Mexican Mafia, drug cartels, Aryan Brotherhood, and the Black gangs all collide. The amazing details of prison life - code words that prisoners use, explanations of how they communicate from cell to cell - really make you feel you have entered a different world, or like you are watching a movie about prison life. The story shows how race riots that can kill prisoners can be started for very small and seemingly unimportant reasons, and how violence permeates every aspect of prison life.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Lock Up Diaries,</i> a drug debt is on the verge of sparking a gang war.&nbsp;</p>";
