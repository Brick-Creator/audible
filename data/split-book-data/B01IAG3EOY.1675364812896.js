window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Women are being murdered in upstate New York, their bodies found mysteriously hanging in chains. With the FBI called in, given the bizarre nature of the murders - and the lack of any clues - there is only one agent they can turn to: Special Agent Riley Paige. </p> <p>Riley, reeling from her last case, is reluctant to take on a new one, since she is still convinced a former serial killer is out there, stalking her. She knows, though, that her ability to enter a serial killer's mind and her obsessive nature is what will be needed to crack this case, and she just can't refuse - even if it will push her over the edge. </p> <p>Riley's search takes her deep into a killer's deluded mind as it leads her to orphanages, mental hospitals, and prisons, all in an effort to understand the depth of his psychosis. Realizing she is up against a true psychopath, she knows time is short before he strikes again. But with her own job on the line and her own family a target, and with her fragile psyche collapsing, it may all be too much for her - and too late. </p>";
