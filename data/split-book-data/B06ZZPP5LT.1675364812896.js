window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Sophie Ducel, her honeymoon in French Polynesia was intended as a celebration of life. For Barry Bleecker, the same trip was meant to mark a new beginning - turning away from his dreary existence in Manhattan finance to seek creative inspiration. But when their small plane is downed in the middle of the South Pacific, the sole survivors of the wreck are left with one common goal: survival. Stranded hundreds of miles from civilization on an island the size of a large city block, the two castaways must reconcile their differences and learn how to draw on one another's strengths. If they don't, they may never make it home. </p>";
