window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>All warrant knight Gavin Kinshield really wants is a letter written 200 years ago by his ancestor, champion to King Arek, confessing the truth of how the king perished - a letter he must earn by tracking down a common thief. But when Gavin saves a woman's life, what should have been a simple task draws him face-to-face with his nightmarish past... and the shocking truth of King Arek's demise. </p> <p>As he unravels the mystery surrounding the last king's death, Gavin's strongest convictions are tested by his greatest fears. He begins a journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance, and along the way, discovers that making difficult choices isn't nearly as painful as accepting their consequences.</p>";
