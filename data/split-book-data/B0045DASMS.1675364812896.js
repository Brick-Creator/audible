window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>A Legacy of Spies</i>. John le Carré’s new novel, <i>Agent Running in the Field</i>, is coming October 2019. In this exquisitely told novel, John le Carré shows us once again his acute understanding of the world we live in and where power really lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and with Britain on the brink of economic ruin, a young English couple takes a vacation in Antigua. There they meet Dima, a Russian who styles himself the world’s number one money launderer and who wants, among other things, a game of tennis. Back in London, the couple is subjected to an interrogation by the British Secret Service, who also need their help. Their acquiescence will lead them on a precarious journey through Paris to a safe house in Switzerland, helpless pawns in a game of nations that reveals the unholy alliances between the Russian mafia, the City of London, the government, and the competing factions of the British Secret Service.&nbsp;</p>";
