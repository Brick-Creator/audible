window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Are you sometimes perplexed with Jesus' teaching? Do you really want what he wants? Best-selling author Kyle Idleman reveals that the key to the abundant life Jesus promised lies in embracing his inside-out way of life. As he examines Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, Kyle unpacks the many counterintuitive truths, including: brokenness is the way to wholeness, mourning is the path to blessing, and emptiness is required in order to know true fullness. Ultimately you will discover how Jesus transforms you as you begin to live out these paradoxical principles. Because only when you come to the end of yourself can you begin to experience the full, blessed, and whole life Jesus offers. </p>";
