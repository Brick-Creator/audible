window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jeanette Garland, missing Castleford, July 1969. Susan Ridyard, missing Rochdale, March 1972. Claire Kemplay, missing Morley, since yesterday. It’s winter, 1974, Yorkshire, Christmas bombs, Lord Lucan on the run, the Bay City Rollers, and Eddie Dunford’s got the job he wanted – crime correspondent for the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i>. He didn’t know it was going to be a season in hell. A dead little girl with a swan’s wings stitched into her back. A gypsy camp in a ring of fire. Corruption everywhere you look.</p> <p>In <i>Nineteen Seventy Four</i>, David Peace brings passion and stylistic bravado to this terrifyingly intense journey into a secret history of sexual obsession and greed, and starts a highly acclaimed crime series that has redefined how the genre is approached.</p> <p>David Peace (born 1967) is an English author. He was named one of the Best of Young British Novelists by <i>Granta</i> in 2003 and won the 2004 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction. He is also known for his novels <i>GB84</i> and <i>The Damned United</i>; the latter was made into a feature film starring Michael Sheen.</p> <p><b>*Please note this audiobook contains explicit language.</b></p>";
