window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the sweltering heat of a Montana July, the small town of Grandview readies for its annual Jamboree. The event is meant to celebrate community, but this year tensions boil over, threatening to tear the town, and a family, apart. </p> <p>Sam Kelvig, a third-generation resident, will do just about anything to protect Grandview from the influx of new oil money and the strangers chasing it. Meanwhile, his restless wife, Patricia, wearies of the constraints of marriage to a man who is so tied to his community; Sam's estranged son, Norby, has reluctantly returned home despite the family's struggle with accepting his sexuality; Henrik, Sam's volatile brother, is looking for any easy opportunity; and Blanche, the family matriarch, only wants a bit of peace before she dies. As Jamboree goes into full swing, the disputes and desires of the Kelvigs - and their friends and neighbors - collide, fueled by both longtime resentments and an irrepressible hope to preserve their family and hometown. </p>";
