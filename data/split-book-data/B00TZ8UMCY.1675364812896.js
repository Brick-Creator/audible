window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i><b>2014 Winner - Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award - Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror</b></i> </p> <p>A single raindrop opens a Pandora's box of horrors when the spawn of perverse genetic research performed during World War II - refined by Cold War enemies and perfected by nature - are unleashed on an unsuspecting world. By dawn only a dead city remains, eerily quiet and still except for the mutant beasts who hide from the light, multiply, and await the shadows of day's end. </p> <p>Ordered to investigate the unfolding crisis, biowarfare specialist Carolyn Ridenour barely escapes the creatures' nocturnal onslaught, saved in the nick of time by Colonel Garrett Hoffmann, who has lost hundreds of his troops to the mutant army that neither bombs nor bullets can break. </p> <p>As Carolyn and Garrett race to stop the plague, a battered and broken US government is preparing to release the fury of America's nuclear arsenal on its own soil.</p>";
