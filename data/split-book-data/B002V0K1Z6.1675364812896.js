window.bookSummaryJSON = "Near Cape Cod, Provincetown, with a gay resort, an art colony, and a working fishing port, has long been a place of freedom, escape, diversity, and risk. Mark Winslow, a Boston comic, arrives with his troupe of actors, ready to break into the Provincetown club circuit. But the town and the region are far from peaceful this summer. When a public fight makes Mark the prime suspect in the grisly death of a Boston blueblood, Mark believes his choice is simple: find the killer or be charged with the crime. <p>Amid the clam shacks and craft shops, art galleries and nude beaches, undercurrents are pulling at the surface of normality. Could the disappearance of a famous painter 80 years in the past - and the story of his masterpiece, <i>The Fisher Boy</i> - somehow lie at the center of the whirlpool of evil threatening to extinguish Mark's life?</p>";
