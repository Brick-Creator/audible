window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, Gustave Flaubert set the bar for scandal, adultery, and financial catastrophe with <i>Madame Bovary</i>. Now, Audible Signature Classics presents two-time Golden Globe Award nominee Leelee Sobieski (<i>Joan of Arc</i>) in a singular new performance that highlights the ambiguity behind a brilliantly crafted character: was Emma Bovary depraved or just a victim of circumstance?</p><p>This is the story of a beautiful woman who marries a devoted, provincial doctor, but believes she was meant for something more—a life of luxury, leisure, and, above all, true and passionate love. She throws herself headlong into a reckless series of doomed affairs, with tragic consequences, and plunges her family into financial ruin.</p><p>Sobieski’s Emma is sultry but vulnerable, offering a sympathetic rendering of the feckless madame and her plight in this cautionary tale of love, passion, and desperation. Will you condemn the madame?</p><p>Listen to more one-of-a-kind performances from actors Elijah Wood, Kenneth Branagh, David Hyde Pierce, and more, only from Audible Signature Classics.</p>";
