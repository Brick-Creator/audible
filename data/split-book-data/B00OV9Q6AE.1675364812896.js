window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From critically acclaimed novelist Bradford Morrow, called \"a mesmerizing storyteller who casts an irresistible spell\" by Joyce Carol Oates and \"one of America's major literary voices\" by <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, comes <i>The Forgers</i>, a richly told thriller about the dark side of the rare book world. </p> <p>The rare book world is stunned when a reclusive collector, Adam Diehl, is found dead on the floor of his Montauk home, hands severed, surrounded by valuable inscribed books and original manuscripts that have been vandalized beyond repair. Adam's sister, Meghan, and her lover, Will - a convicted but unrepentant literary forger - struggle to come to terms with the seemingly incomprehensible murder. But when Will begins receiving threatening letters written in the handwriting of long-dead authors from someone who knows secrets about Adam's death and Will's past, he understands his own life is also on the line. </p> <p><i>The Forgers</i> delves deeply into the passions that drive collectors to the razor's edge of morality, brilliantly confronting the hubris and mortal danger of attempting to rewrite history with a fraudulent pen.</p>";
