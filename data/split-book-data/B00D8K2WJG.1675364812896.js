window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fresh out of federal witness protection and enjoying the pleasures of Venice, Italy, former mobster Vinny Fabrizio is offered the criminal chance of a lifetime: $10 million to destroy a crucially located container ship port and a shot at his FBI nemesis, Jack Rivers. The catch? He's being paid by anti-American Islamic insurgents, and the port is back home on American soil. As Vinny weighs his pangs of patriotism and the opportunity for a bloody revenge, Jack struggles to remain loyal to his own family and make a name for himself at his new job as director of security - at the very port Vinny is planning to blow up. </p> <p>The two men speed toward each other on a dangerous collision course that threatens to destroy much more than just each other. Behind his sinister smirk, Vinny hides an unexpected weakness: Linda, a gorgeous, strong-willed southern belle who must decide if she's willing to risk it all for real love. The stakes are high, and the clock is ticking...</p>";
