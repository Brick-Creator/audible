window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How do I give myself to God completely? What happens when I do? </p> <p>This is a book for everyone who has ever asked these questions. </p> <p><i>I Dared to Call Him Father</i> is the fascinating true story of Bilquis Sheikh, a prominent Muslim woman in Pakistan who faced these questions at the crossroads of her life and found the astonishing answers. Her unusual journey to a personal relationship with God turned her world upside down - and put her life in danger - as a series of strange dreams launched her on a quest that would forever consume her heart, mind, and soul. </p> <p>Originally published in 1978, the book has sold 300,000 copies and is a classic in Muslim evangelism. </p> <p>Bilquis Sheikh came from a family in Pakistan that held government power for seven hundred years. She was also the wife of a high ranking government official in Pakistan. She gave her life to Jesus Christ in 1966. In 1972, sponsored by Samaritanâ€™s Purse, she resettled in the United States, where she spoke widely and shared her faith with many. Years later she returned to Pakistan, where she died in 1997. She was given a Christian funeral.</p>";
