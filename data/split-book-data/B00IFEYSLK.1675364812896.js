window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A compulsively listenable, deeply human novel that examines our most basic and unquenchable emotion: want. </p><p>With his critically acclaimed first novel, Jonathan Miles was widely praised as a comic genius \"after something bigger\" (David Ulin, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>) whose fiction was \"not just philosophically but emotionally rewarding\" (Richard Russo, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, front cover). </p><p>Now, in his much-anticipated second novel, <i>Want Not</i>, Miles takes a giant leap forward with this highly inventive and corrosively funny story of our times, a three-pronged tale of human excess that sifts through the detritus of several disparate lives - lost loves, blown chances, countless words, and deeds misdirected or misunderstood - all conjoined in their come-hell-or-high-water search for fulfillment. </p><p>As the novel opens on Thanksgiving Day, listeners are telescoped into three different worlds in various states of disrepair - a young freegan couple living off the grid in New York City; a once-prominent linguist, sacked at midlife by the dissolution of his marriage and his father’s losing battle with Alzheimer’s; and a self-made debt-collecting magnate, whose brute talent for squeezing money out of unlikely places has yielded him a royal existence, trophy wife included. </p><p>Want and desire propel these characters forward toward something, anything, more, until their worlds collide, briefly, randomly, yet irrevocably, in a shattering ending that will haunt listeners long after the last lines. </p><p>With a satirist’s eye and a romantic’s heart, Miles captures the morass and comedy of contemporary life in all its excess. Bold, unblinking, unforgettable in its irony and pathos, <i>Want Not</i> is a wicked, big-hearted literary novel that confirms the arrival of a major voice in American fiction.</p>";
