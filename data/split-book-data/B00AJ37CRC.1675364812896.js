window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Selected by Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the century and called \"Evelyn Waugh's finest achievement\" by the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>,</b><b><i> Brideshead Revisited</i></b><b> is a stunning exploration of desire, duty, and memory. Read by Jeremy Irons, star of the acclaimed 1981 television series based on the novel. </b></p> <p>The wellsprings of desire and the impediments to love come brilliantly into focus in Evelyn Waugh's masterpiece - a novel that immerses us in the glittering and seductive world of English aristocracy in the waning days of the empire. Through the story of Charles Ryder's entanglement with the Flytes, a great Catholic family, Evelyn Waugh charts the passing of the privileged world he knew in his own youth and vividly recalls the sensuous pleasures denied him by wartime austerities.&nbsp;</p> <p>At once romantic, sensuous, comic, and somber, <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> transcends Waugh's early satiric explorations and reveals him to be an elegiac, lyrical novelist of the utmost feeling and lucidity.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"A genuine literary masterpiece.\" (<i>Time</i>)</p> <p>\"Heartbreakingly beautiful...The 20th century's finest English novel.\" (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)</p>";
