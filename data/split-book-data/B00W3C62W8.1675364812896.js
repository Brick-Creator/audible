window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now a five-part limited event series on Showtime, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Blythe Danner. </b></p> <p>Edward St. Aubyn has penned one of the most acclaimed series of the decade with the Patrick Melrose Novels. Now you can listen to all five novels in one volume: <i>Never Mind</i>, <i>Bad News</i>, <i>Mother's Milk</i>, <i>Some Hope</i>, and <i>At Last</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>By turns harrowing and hilarious, this ambitious novel cycle dissects the English upper class. Edward St. Aubyn offers his listener the often darkly funny and self-loathing world of privilege as we follow Patrick Melrose's story of abuse, addiction, and recovery from the age of five into early middle age. The Patrick Melrose novels comprise a modern masterpiece by one of \"the most brilliant English novelists of his generation\" (Alan Hollinghurst).&nbsp;</p> <p>The Patrick Melrose novels as read by Alex Jennings were nominated for a 2015 Audie Award in Literary Fiction.&nbsp;</p>";
