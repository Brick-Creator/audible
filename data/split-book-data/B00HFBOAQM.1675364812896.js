window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A gripping tale of survival and an epic love story in which a husband and wife, separated by the only battle of World War II to take place on American soil, fight to reunite in Alaska's starkly beautiful Aleutian Islands.</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Following the death of his younger brother in Europe, journalist John Easley is determined to find meaning in his loss, to document some part of the growing war that claimed his own flesh and blood. Leaving behind his beloved wife, Helen, after an argument they both regret, he heads north from Seattle to investigate the Japanese invasion of Alaska's Aleutian Islands, a story censored by the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p> <p>While John is accompanying a crew on a bombing run, his plane is shot down over the island of Attu. He survives only to find himself exposed to a harsh and unforgiving wilderness, known as \"the Birthplace of Winds.\" There, John must battle the elements, starvation, and his own remorse while evading discovery by the Japanese.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alone in their home 3,000 miles to the south, Helen struggles with the burden of her husband's disappearance. Caught in extraordinary circumstances, in this new world of the missing, she is forced to reimagine who she is, and what she is capable of doing. Somehow, she must find John and bring him home, a quest that takes her into the farthest reaches of the war, beyond the safety of everything she knows.&nbsp;</p> <p>A powerful, richly atmospheric story of life and death, commitment and sacrifice, <i>The Wind Is Not a River</i> illuminates the fragility of life and the fierce power of love.&nbsp;</p>";
