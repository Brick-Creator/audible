window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The strife and horrors of the Civil War in America were raw with the wounds of the war lasting for decades; and affecting those who lived in both the North and the South. As the nation struggled to find unity, the forces of darkness and of those who wished to rule through intimidation and terror, spread their wicked ways under the cover of white sheets. </p> <p>This is the story of the Ku Klux Klan and their chief brand: Lynchings, as told in the original newspaper stories from journals across the nation. Some are brief, telling only of a single attack while others are more comprehensive and detailed, telling the story with the inclusion of complex and emotional occurrences. </p> <p>The attempt of the KKK to cloak the power of control over others with fear and violence is explained in some of these news stories. The chief advocate and leader of the Klan was interviewed by reporters and allowed fair access to give his side of the story. The heroism of various groups such as the NAACP and others who risked their lives standing up to thugs and criminals is also noted, as well as the words of those individuals and leaders who fought to eliminate the influence of the Ku Klux Klan. </p> <p>While the KKK had as much right as any group to demonstrate and articulate their cause, the deceits and criminal actions employed by them separated their group from the legal actions of others. </p> <p>For listeners in the 21st Century who know little of the life and death of the KKK, the admonition to understand and know history in order to avoid repeating it, should be considered. Therefore, it is in that hope that this audiobook has been prepared. WARNING: Authentic descriptions are vivid and brutal and the racially charged language of this historic news reports and commentary has not been modified. This material is for adults and parental guidance is appropriate. </p>";
