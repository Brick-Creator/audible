window.bookSummaryJSON = "Mole is happy with his life until, one day, in the middle of spring-cleaning, he emerges from his hole at Mole End and starts meandering around the English countryside. Everything is new for the simple but stalwart Mole. Never before has he seen a river, taken a boat ride, or encountered the woods. <p>But this is nothing compared to what awaits him when he gets tangled up in the escapades of the indomitable Mr. Toad, the society-hating Badger of Wild Wood, and the easy-going Water Rat! Motorcars, gypsies, jailbreaks, and a weasel rebellion are all in store for these intrepid animals. Beyond mischievous life adventures, the story conveys the typical turn of 20th-century life in Britain and the struggle between the noisy, common way and the more genteel life.</p>";
