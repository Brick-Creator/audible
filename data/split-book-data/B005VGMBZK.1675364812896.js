window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of the international and <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Let the Right One In (Let Me In)</i> comes this stunning and terrifying book which begins when a man's six-year-old daughter vanishes. </p> <p>One ordinary winter afternoon on a snowy island, Anders and Cecilia take their six-year-old daughter, Maja, across the ice to visit the lighthouse in the middle of the frozen channel. While the couple explore the lighthouse, Maja disappears - either into thin air or under thin ice - leaving not even a footprint in the snow. Two years later, alone and more or less permanently drunk, Anders returns to the island to regroup. He slowly realizes that people are not telling him all they know; even his own mother, it seems, is keeping secrets. What is happening in Domaro, and what power does the sea have over the town's inhabitants? </p> <p>As he did with <i>Let the Right One In</i> and <i>Handling the Undead</i>, John Ajvide Lindqvist serves up a blockbuster cocktail of suspense in a narrative that barely pauses for breath.</p>";
