window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Liz Murray was born to loving but drug-addicted parents in the Bronx. In school she was taunted for her dirty clothing and lice-infested hair, eventually skipping so many classes that she was put into a girls' home. At age 15, Liz found herself on the streets when her family finally unraveled. She learned to scrape by, foraging for food and riding subways all night to have a warm place to sleep. </p> <p>When Liz's mother died of AIDS, she decided to take control of her own destiny and go back to high school, often completing her assignments in the hallways and subway stations where she slept. Liz squeezed four years of high school into two, while homeless; won a <i>New York Times</i> scholarship; and made it into the Ivy League. </p> <p><i>Breaking Night</i> is an unforgettable and beautifully written story of one woman's indomitable spirit to survive and prevail, against all odds.</p>";
