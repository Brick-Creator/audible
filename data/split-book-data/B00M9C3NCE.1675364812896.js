window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The plan is simple. George and Ben have three weeks to cycle 1,000 miles from the bottom of England to the top of Scotland. There's just one small problem - they have no bikes, no clothes, no food, and no money. Setting off in just a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts, they attempt to rely on the generosity of the British public for everything from food to accommodation, clothes to shoes, and bikes to beer. </p> <p>During the most extraordinary of challenges, George and Ben scavenge through rubbish bins, search for the Loch Ness monster, wash dishes, clean hotels, sing Christmas carols for food, swim in lakes, descend Cornish hills on children's bikes, and cook a barbecue for 30 old people in a field. They spend the night in a greenhouse, a canal boat, a posh hotel, an empty house, a pub, a tent in a car park, and a barn with a bull. </p> <p>Through the course of their hysterical journey, they are clothed, fed, and sheltered by the generous people of Britain.</p>";
