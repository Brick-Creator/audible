window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The scarcely populated town of Sweetland rests on the shore of a remote Canadian island. Its slow decline finally reaches a head when the mainland government offers each islander a generous resettlement package - the sole stipulation being that everyone must leave. Fierce and enigmatic Moses Sweetland, whose ancestors founded the village, is the only one to refuse. As he watches his neighbors abandon the island, he recalls the town's rugged history and its eccentric cast of characters. Evoking <i>The Shipping News</i>, Michael Crummey - one of Canada's finest novelists - conjures up the mythical, sublime world of Sweetland's past amid a storm-battered landscape haunted by local lore. As in his critically acclaimed novel <i>Galore</i>, Crummey masterfully weaves together past and present, creating in Sweetland a spectacular portrait of one man's battle to survive as his environment vanishes around him. </p>";
