window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Experience the mystery and suspense of the best-selling legal thriller. </p> <p>Can too big to fail get away with murder? </p> <p>Read the compelling legal novel by the best-selling author of <i>An Involuntary Spy</i>. Brent Marks had paid his dues as a lawyer, having taken his share of divorces and drunk driving cases over his 20 year career, but had finally reached a place in his life where he could take on cases of social importance. What he least expected was for April Marsh's predatory lending case against the big banks for wrongful foreclosure on her parent's home to turn into a murder investigation. April's mother was murdered. Her father was beaten within an inch of his life, and she believes their predatory lender is to blame. Are banks really that above the law?</p>";
