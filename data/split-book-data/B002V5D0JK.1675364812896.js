window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AS</b><b><i>&nbsp;I HEARD YOU PAINT HOUSES</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;Best Seller</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Now a major motion picture directed by Academy Award® winner Martin Scorsese, starring Academy Award® winners Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Anna Paquin, and Academy Award® nominee Harvey Keitel, and written by Academy Award® winner Steven Zaillian.</b></p> <p><i>The Irishman</i>&nbsp;“gives new meaning to the term ‘guilty pleasure.’’’ (Bryan Burrough, author of&nbsp;<i>Public Enemies</i>, in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>“Told with such economy and chilling force as to make&nbsp;<i>The Sopranos</i>&nbsp;suddenly seem overwrought and theatrical.” (<i>New York Daily News</i>)</p> <p>“A terrific read.” (<i>Kansas City Star</i>)</p> <p><i>The Irishman</i>&nbsp;is an epic saga of organized crime in post-war America told through the eyes of World War II veteran Frank Sheeran, a hustler and hitman who worked for legendary crime boss Russell Bufalino alongside some of the most notorious figures of the 20th Century. Spanning decades, Sheeran’s story chronicles one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in American history, the disappearance of legendary union boss Jimmy Hoffa, and it offers a monumental journey through the hidden corridors of organized crime: its inner workings, rivalries, and connections to mainstream politics. Sheeran would rise to a position of such prominence that in a RICO suit against The Commission of La Cosa Nostra, the US Government would name him as one of only two non-Italians in conspiracy with the Commission. Sheeran is listed alongside the likes of Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano and Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the course of nearly five years of recorded interviews, Sheeran confessed to Charles Brandt that he handled more than 25 hits for the mob, and Brandt turned Sheeran’s story into a pause-resisting true crime classic.&nbsp;</p>";
