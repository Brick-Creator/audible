window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Clean</i> offers a groundbreaking program to eliminate minor and major health problems - from extra weight, chronic pain, and allergies to heart disease, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and depression. </p> <p>All of today's most diagnosed ailments can be traced back to an injured and irritated gut. The gut is an intricate and powerful system naturally designed to protect and heal the body every moment of every day. And yet for far too many of us this remarkable system is in disrepair, which leads to all kinds of health problems. We are sick and getting sicker. Chronic diseases are on the rise, and everyone we know seems to be suffering from something, getting tests done and taking over-the-counter or prescription medications. But we no longer have to be sick to get healthy. Dr. Alejandro Junger explains how instead of treating the symptoms as they arise, we can preemptively attack disease before it takes root in the gut. </p> <p>No matter your current state of health, you will benefit from this program. We are all walking around with damaged guts, to different degrees suffering the consequences in our day-to-day and long-term health. The Clean Gut program will put an end to these everyday ailments, reverse chronic disease, and help you achieve true, long-lasting health. </p>";
