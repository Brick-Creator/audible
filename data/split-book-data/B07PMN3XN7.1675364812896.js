window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eve Larrison has a rare gift: as a hyper-polyglot she speaks over 60 languages. She's uniquely qualified to assist in an attempted kidnapping case that has international overtones. But this assignment is exceptional. The target of the abduction is Royce Raiker, stepson of the head of The Mindhunters. And she'll be going into deep cover with Declan Gallagher - as his \"wife\". She never suspected that the pretend marriage would be the toughest part of the assignment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Declan knows he can ill-afford distractions on this assignment, and Eve Larrison provides one hell of a distraction. They realize that Royce will never be safe until the people who targeted him are brought to justice. But as Declan and Eve infiltrate the group responsible, it quickly becomes apparent that to solve the case they'll need to unravel the questions surrounding the boy's birth. The only ones who knew those secrets are dead. And digging into the old mystery has them both marked for the same fate....</p>";
