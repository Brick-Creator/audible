window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Soon to be a motion picture starring Harry Styles, Emma Corrin, and David Dawson, an&nbsp;exquisitely told, tragic tale of thwarted love.</b></p> <p><b>“Stunning...fraught and honest.” (</b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>It is in 1950s Brighton that Marion first catches sight of Tom. He teaches her to swim, gently guiding her through the water in the shadow of the city's famous pier, and Marion is smitten - determined her love alone will be enough for them both. A few years later, near the Brighton Museum, Patrick meets Tom. Patrick is besotted, and opens Tom's eyes to a glamorous, sophisticated new world of art, travel, and beauty. Tom is their policeman, and in this age it is safer for him to marry Marion and meet Patrick in secret. The two lovers must share him, until one of them breaks and three lives are destroyed.</p> <p>In this evocative portrait of midcentury England, Bethan Roberts reimagines the real-life relationship the novelist E. M. Forster had with a policeman, Bob Buckingham, and his wife. <i>My Policeman</i> is a deeply heartfelt story of love's passionate endurance, and the devastation wrought by a repressive society.</p>";
