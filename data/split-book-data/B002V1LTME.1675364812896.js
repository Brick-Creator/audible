window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1989 Ken Follett astonished the literary world with <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, a sweeping epic novel set in 12th-century England that centered on the building of a cathedral and the men, women, and children whose lives it changed forever. Critics were overwhelmed, and readers and listeners ever since have hoped for a sequel.&nbsp;</p> <p>At last, here it is. Although the two novels may be listened to in any order, <i>World Without End</i> takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge.&nbsp;</p> <p>Three years in the writing, <i>World Without End</i> once again shows that Ken Follett is a masterful author writing at the top of his craft.</p>";
