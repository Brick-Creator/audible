window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the end finally occurred, everything about it was cinematic. The dead came back and ate people, civilization collapsed, and no one could do a thing. But Cyrus V. Sinclair couldn’t care less; he’s a sociopath.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amidst the chaos, Cyrus sits back and contemplates the gore stained streets and screams of his fellow man with little more emotion than one of the walking corpses. With his cache of guns and MREs, he rather likes the idea of hunkering down in his Seattle apartment while the world ends outside.&nbsp;</p> <p>All is well and good for Cyrus… until he meets up with Gabe, a belligerent annoyance, and the other inconvenient survivors who cramp his style and force him to re-evaluate his outlook on life. It’s Armageddon, and things will definitely get messy.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>BONUS SHORT STORY:</b> <i>The Undead Situation</i> includes \"Strictly Professional\", one of four interlocking stories from <i>The Junkie Quatrain</i> by Peter Clines.</p>";
