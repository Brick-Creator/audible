For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful 13-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims - a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story - and survive this homecoming.</p> <p><b>Praise for</b><b><i>&nbsp;Sharp Objects</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p><b>“Nasty, addictive reading.” (</b><b><i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Skillful and disturbing.” (</b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“Darkly original...[a] riveting tale.” (</b><b><i>People</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
