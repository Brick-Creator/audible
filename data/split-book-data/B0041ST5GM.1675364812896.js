window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Once upon a time, there was a young psychiatrist called Hector who was not very satisfied with himself....” </p> <p>Hector is very good at treating patients in need of his help. But he can’t do much for those who are simply dissatisfied with life, and that is beginning to depress him. When a patient tells him he looks in need of a vacation, Hector takes a trip around the world to learn what makes people happy—and sad. As he travels from Paris to China to Africa to the United States, he lists his observations about the people he meets. Is there a secret to happiness, and will Hector find it? </p> <p>Combining the winsome appeal of <i>The Little Prince</i> with the inspiring philosophy of <i>The Alchemist</i>, Hector’s journey ventures around the globe and into the human soul. Lelord’s writing inspires us to consider life’s great questions. Uplifting, empowering, and optimistic, this is a fable for our times and all time.</p>";
