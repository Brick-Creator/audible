window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Garth Stein, the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i>, Audible presents <i>How Evan Broke His Head and Other Secrets</i>, winner of a Pacific Northwest Bookseller Award—in audio for the first time, and read by one of our most talented narrators, Oliver Wyman. </p> <p>Thirty-one-year-old Seattle rocker Evan has been drifting. He had a hit single ten years ago, but lately he’s merely been getting by, teaching middle-aged men how to play the electric guitar. When his high-school girlfriend is killed in a car crash, he suddenly finds himself responsible for Dean, the fourteen-year-old son he’s never known. </p> <p>Dean changes everything. Evan can't keep drifting now that he's a father. He will have to do something about his life if he's going to provide for the two of them. Partly this will mean finally confronting his own father. It will also mean facing up to the nagging, burning issue that is like a hole in his soul: the epilepsy that haunts him and threatens his every moment.</p>";
