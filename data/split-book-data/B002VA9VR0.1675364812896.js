window.bookSummaryJSON = "This <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book - \"intelligent as it is gripping\" ( <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) - is the critically lauded, best-selling debut from Iranian-born author Dalia Sofer. <p>Accused of spying for Israel, Isaac Amin's real crime is simply being Jewish, which gets him tossed into jail after the Iranian Revolution feeds the flames of Islamic fanaticism. As Isaac endures the brutality of imprisonment, his wife fights despair while searching for answers.</p> <p>Hoping to prevent further injustices, his precocious daughter steals files from the man in charge of the prison. And half a world away in Brooklyn, Isaac's adult son suffers when his family's financial support vanishes. </p> <p>Sofer, who fled Iran in 1982 when her own father was unjustly imprisoned, draws from personal experience to create a powerful novel that captures both sidesof the Iranian struggle.</p>";
