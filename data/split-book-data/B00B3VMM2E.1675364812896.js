window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Dirty God: Jesus in the Trenches,</i> Johnnie Moore draws on both Scripture and his extensive experience with other cultures and religions to show how the God of the Bible is unique in his willingness to be near us in all of our messiness. Moore outlines the central importance of the doctrine of grace while introducing readers to a humble and human Jesus who reaches out to us at our worst and pulls us up to our best. Grace, Moore argues, is something that is both gotten and given, and the two-part structure of the book allows listeners to explore both of these dynamics. </p> <p>By offering hope rather than condemnation and showing the practical applications of grace in todayâ€™s world, <i>Dirty God</i> will appeal to both the committed Christian and the spiritual seeker looking for a more authentic faith. Challenging and engaging, <i>Dirty God</i> is sure to establish Johnnie Moore as an emerging voice for Millennial and Gen-X evangelicals for years to come.</p>";
