window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Named <i>Book of the Month</i> Club's Book of the Year, 2017</p> <p>Selected one of <i>New York Times</i> Readersâ€™ Favorite Books of 2017</p> <p>Winner of the 2018 Goldsboro Books Glass Bell Award&nbsp;</p> <p><b>From the beloved </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</i></b><b>, a sweeping, heartfelt saga about the course of one man's life, beginning and ending in post-war Ireland. </b></p> <p>Cyril Avery is not a <i>real</i> Avery - or at least, that's what his adoptive parents tell him. And he never will be. But if he isn't a real Avery, then who is he?&nbsp;</p> <p>Born out of wedlock to a teenage girl cast out from her rural Irish community and adopted by a well-to-do if eccentric Dublin couple via the intervention of a hunchbacked Redemptorist nun, Cyril is adrift in the world, anchored only tenuously by his heartfelt friendship with the infinitely more glamourous and dangerous Julian Woodbead. At the mercy of fortune and coincidence, he will spend a lifetime coming to know himself and where he came from - and over his many years, will struggle to discover an identity, a home, a country, and much more.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this, Boyne's most transcendent work to date, we are shown the story of Ireland from the 1940s to today through the eyes of one ordinary man. <i>The Heart's Invisible Furies</i> is a novel to make you laugh and cry while reminding us all of the redemptive power of the human spirit.&nbsp;</p>";
