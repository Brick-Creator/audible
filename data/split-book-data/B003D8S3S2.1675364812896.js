In his path waits Shel Beaudry, a knockout redhead with a smile that says, \"Gentlemen, start your engines.\" The attraction is instant - and soon the two are living the gypsy life on the West Coast, where Dan captains a distribution ring for premium Thai marijuana. His credo: \"No guns, no gangsters, it's only money.\" </p><p>But the trade is changing. Eager to get out, Dan plans one last run, judges poorly, and is betrayed by an underling and caught by the DEA. To secure light time for Shel and his crew, Dan takes the fall and pleads to 10 years.
