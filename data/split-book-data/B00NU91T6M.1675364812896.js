window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Thirteen years ago, Frank Pavlicek left the NYPD under less than ideal circumstances. Now, the divorced father of a teenage daughter, he works as a private investigator in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he indulges his passion for falconry - and tries to live outside the shadow of his past. </p> <p>Frank is hunting with his red-tailed hawk Armistead, when he finds it. A teenage boy's body - barely concealed behind a pile of brush. But what Frank finds in the dead boy's wallet is even more disturbing: his daughter's phone number, scribbled in ink on the edge of a bill. He pockets the evidence and flees. Days later, his daughter is in jail. His past is coming back to haunt him. And his reputation - and life - are on the line. </p> <p>Originally published by NAL/Signet/Penguin.</p>";
