window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A savage death. A serial killer behind bars. Can Inspector Drake stop a clever murderer on a determined killing spree?</b></p> <p>Inspector Drake is called to the holiday home of an eminent Manchester barrister and recently appointed judge to face the grizzly sight of his badly mutilated body. The scene resembles a copycat killing from years previously, when the barrister had prosecuted the perpetrator now serving life in prison.</p> <p>Drake realizes the killer might be targeting the judge, the legal teams, or the journalist who covered the original trial, and he embarks on a frantic search to identify and warn them all. But when a friend of the barrister is found murdered in his yacht in a marina, Drake’s suspicion must focus on the barrister’s connections.</p> <p>Clear evidence that arises to arrest and charge a suspect is thrown into confusion when another death takes place. Drake knows he has a determined killer to catch. And with his own reputation and the integrity of the Wales Police Service on the line, he cannot afford mistakes.</p> <p>Can he catch the killer and avert more deaths? <i>Written in Blood</i> is the sixth book in the dynamic Inspector Drake crime series. If you like police procedurals, clever mysteries, and gripping thrillers, then you’ll love Stephen Puleston’s Ian Drake novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
