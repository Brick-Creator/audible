window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jan 1, 1955 </p> <p>Henry Wood is suffering greatly from a festive night of saying goodbye to 1954. His world is one of black and white, right and wrong, but his life is about to change and there will forever be shades of grey. An average detective, with a passion for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Henry is about to be hired by a beautiful woman, to find her father and his journal. It seems simple enough, but when a second woman appears, wanting his services, to find the same journal, he suspects he might be in over his head. He's right. They are the least of his problems. The local mafia boss, Tommy 'The Knife', wants the journal too. As long as it is missing, he is vulnerable, and the other bosses smell blood in the water. Who can Henry trust? Henry has a mysterious benefactor that he has never met, but seems to have his best interest at heart. Will Henry take the help that is offered? Does he have a choice?</p>";
