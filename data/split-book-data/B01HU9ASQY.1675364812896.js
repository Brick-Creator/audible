window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bestselling Polish crime by award-winning author Zygmunt Miloszewski.</b> </p> <p>All eyes are on famous prosecutor Teodor Szacki when he investigates a skeleton discovered at a construction site in the idyllic Polish city of Olsztyn. Old bones come as no shock to anyone in this part of Poland, but it turns out these remains are fresh, the flesh chemically removed. </p> <p>Szacki questions the dead man's wife, only to be left with a suspicion she's hiding something. Then another victim surfaces - a violent husband, alive but maimed - giving rise to a theory: someone's targeting domestic abusers. And as new clues bring the murderer closer to those Szacki holds dear, he begins to understand the terrible rage that drives people to murder. </p> <p>From acclaimed Polish crime writer Zygmunt Miloszewski comes a gritty, atmospheric pause resister that poses the question, what drives a sane man to kill? </p>";
