window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A compelling novel of desire, secrecy, and sexual identity, <i>In One Person</i> is a story of unfulfilled love—tormented, funny, and affecting—and an impassioned embrace of our sexual differences. Billy, the bisexual narrator and main character of <i>In One Person</i>, tells the tragicomic story (lasting more than half a century) of his life as a “sexual suspect,” a phrase first used by John Irving in 1978 in his landmark novel of “terminal cases,” <i>The World According to Garp</i>.</p> <p>His most political novel since <i>The Cider House Rules</i> and A Prayer for Owen Meany, John Irving’s <i>In One Person</i> is a poignant tribute to Billy’s friends and lovers—a theatrical cast of characters who defy category and convention. Not least, <i>In One Person</i> is an intimate and unforgettable portrait of the solitariness of a bisexual man who is dedicated to making himself “worthwhile.”</p>";
