window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This audiobook is about getting what you want by relaxing more. </p> <p>More specifically, this audiobook will show you the necessity of relaxing in order to get what you want. The unusual recommendations we're about to go over are practical suggestions that you can start using immediately. Whatever you are looking for in life - whether it's more money, improved health, better relationships, more free time, a greater sense of well-being, or a fancier car - you'll often get it faster if you try less. </p> <p>Obviously, this isn't the normal way we think about how to acquire what we want. Our first inclination is always to try harder if we deeply desire something. We think we must work hard, and put in a lot of effort, in order to make our desires come to fruition. </p> <p>But the truth of the matter is that trying hard does not work well for most people. The majority of us who try hard to improve our lives still don't get what we really want. We want to get better things in our life, we try very hard to get them - and our best intentions still manage to get screwed up. I can't begin to tell you how many times I have tried hard and still managed to fail in reaching my goal. It's nothing to be embarrassed about; it's just the truth. Most of the time trying so hard really doesn't get us what we hope it will. </p> <p>So here's a logical question: what would happen if we stopped trying so hard? What if there's an easier way to receive what we want in life? What if we allow ourselves, instead of trying hard, to relax with more consistency? </p> <p>The surprising answer is that by relaxing more we can immediately start to feel wealthy within ourselves. And, from there, an even more stunning development occurs: our new sense of self-wealth miraculously starts to manifest itself in our outer world. </p>";
