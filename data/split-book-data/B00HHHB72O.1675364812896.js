window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A March of Kings</i> takes us one step further on Thor's epic journey into manhood, as he begins to realize more about who he is and what his powers are, and as he embarks to become a warrior. </p> <p>After he escapes from the dungeon, Thor is horrified to learn of another assassination attempt on King MacGil. When MacGil dies, the kingdom is set into turmoil. As everyone vies for the throne, King's Court is rifer than ever with its family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence, and betrayal. An heir must be chosen from among the children, and the ancient Dynasty Sword, the source of all their power, will have a chance to be wielded by someone new. But all this might be upended: The murder weapon is recovered, and the noose tightens on finding the assassin. Simultaneously, the MacGils face a new threat from the McClouds, who are set to attack again from within the Ring. </p> <p>Thor fights to win back Gwendolyn's love, but there may not be time: He is told to pack up, to prepare with his brothers-in-arms for The Hundred, a hundred grueling days of hell that all Legion members must survive. The Legion will have to cross the Canyon, beyond the protection of the Ring, into the Wilds, and set sail across the Tartuvian Sea for the Isle of Mist, said to be patrolled by a dragon, for their initiation into manhood. </p> <p>Will they make it back? Will the Ring survive in their absence? And will Thor finally learn the secret of his destiny? </p>";
