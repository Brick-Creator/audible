window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Betrayed and left for dead, Corin Hugh emerges victorious from a mind-bending adventure in the distant past with a powerful thirst for vengeance - and strange new powers. He soon sees the perfect opportunity to right the wrong that he suffered and save an innocent victim. The focus of his wrath is Ethan Blake, the sly traitor who incited Corin's men to betray him. But Corin must move fast because Blake has resumed his former position among the mighty - and seemingly invincible - tyrant Vestossis. Aiding Corin in his quest is the lovely and mysterious druid Aemilia, who somehow seems to know Corin's very soul. Together, the two unlikely heroes must join forces and, ultimately, learn to trust one another as they struggle against earthly tyranny, capricious gods, and time itself in an epic battle for freedom and good. </p>";
