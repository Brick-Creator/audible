window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As the Nazis come to power in Germany, a violent argument over a secret key causes young Johann to lose the only parent he has left. Worse, it is his half-brother, Dieter, who commits this horrific act of betrayal. Though their fragile family bonds are irrevocably destroyed, the brothers’ paths are destined to cross again. Years later, in 1945, Hitler’s army is on the verge of defeat as Soviet forces enter Germany. Hiding in plain sight, Johann works to save German lives, secretly despising the Führer to whom Dieter has sworn his allegiance. Yet now it is Dieter who holds a terrible secret that threatens not just Johann and his family, but an entire city unsuspecting of the enemy within. As Germany falls before the Allies’ merciless advance, Johann and Dieter are locked in their own furious battle while the fate of the entire city of Berlin rests in their hands. </p>";
