window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Exclusively from Audible</b> </p> <p>The story of a woman's struggle for independence from an abusive husband. Helen 'Graham' has returned to Wildfell Hall in flight from a disastrous marriage and to protect her young son from the influence of his father. </p> <p>Exiled to the desolate moorland mansion, she adopts an assumed name and earns her living as a painter. Gilbert Markham, a local man intrigued by the beautiful young 'widow' offers his friendship but becomes distrustful when her reclusive behaviour sparks rumours and speculation. When she offers her diary for him to read only then does he discover the dark truth of her shocking past. </p> <p>The second and last novel written by Anne Brontë, the youngest of the six Brontë children, <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> deals with alcoholism, physical and emotional abuse, unhappy marriages and adultery. Anne's novels are distinctly different from that of her sisters, filled with gritty realism. After her death, Anne's sister, Charlotte, prevented its republication perhaps due to her belief that it was overly graphic and an 'entire mistake'. </p> <p>Despite first being published in 1848, <i>The Independent</i> described it as a 'frighteningly up-to-date tale of single motherhood and wife-battering.' It is considered one of the more shocking of the Brontë stories and due to Helen's breaking of social convention and law holds firm as one of the first feminist novels. </p> <p><i>Narrator Biography </i> </p> <p>Three-time Olivier Award winner actor Alex Jennings is known for portraying Prince Charles in <i>The Queen</i> (2006) as well as appearing in <i>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</i> (2004), <i>Babel</i> (2006) and <i>The Lady in the Van</i> (2015).

She starred in the critically acclaimed 1971 film <i>Walkabout</i> as well as receiving a string of Hollywood roles.
