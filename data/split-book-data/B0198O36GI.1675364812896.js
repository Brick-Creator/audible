window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A debut novel to charm all listeners that shows beyond all doubt that it's books, along with love, that make the world go round. </p> <p>It all began with a correspondence between two quite different women: 28-year-old Sara from Haninge, Sweden, and 65-year-old Amy from the small town of Broken Wheel, Iowa. After years of exchanging books, letters, and thoughts on the meaning of literature and life, Sara, mousy, disheveled, who has never been anywhere in her life - has really lived only for her work in a beloved bookshop, which has just closed its doors for the last time - bravely decides to accept her unknown friend's invitation to visit. But when she arrives, she finds her house empty, the funeral guests just heading home.... </p> <p>Sara finds herself alone. And what choice do the inhabitants of Broken Wheel have but to take care of their bewildered tourist? And what choice does Sara have, faced with a town where nobody reads and her desire to honour her friend, but to set up the perfect bookshop with all the books she and Amy shared - from Yann Martel's <i>Life of Pi</i> to Iris Murdoch and Jo Nesbo, to Bridget Jones and Doug Coupland's <i>All Families Are Psychotic</i> to <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>? And then watch as the townsfolk are, one by one, transformed in unexpected ways.... </p> <p>In the glorious tradition of <i>84 Charing Cross Road</i>, <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i>, <i>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café</i>, Will Schwalbe's <i>The End of Your Life Book Club</i>, Jane Austen, and movies such as <i>You've Got Mail </i>and <i>Love Actually</i>, <i>The Readers of Broken Wheel Recommend </i>is a big-hearted, witty book about books, friendship, love - and always being open to the unexpected. </p>";
