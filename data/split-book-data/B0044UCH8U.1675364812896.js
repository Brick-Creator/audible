window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the story comic book legend Stan Lee calls \"spellbinding\" and \"totally original,\" Thom Creed has secrets. For one, like his father, he has super powers. Also, he's been asked to join the League—the very organization of superheroes that spurned his dad. Then theres the secret Thom can barely face himself: he's gay.</p> <p>But becoming a member of the League opens up a new world to Thom. There, he connects with a misfit group of aspiring heroes, including Scarlett, who can control fire but not her anger; Typhoid Larry, who can make anyone sick with his touch; and Ruth, a wise old broad who can see the future. Like Thom, these heroes have things to hide; but they will have to learn to trust one another when they uncover a deadly conspiracy within the League.</p> <p>To survive, Thom will face challenges he never imagined. To find happiness, he'll have to come to terms with his fathers past, and discover the kind of hero he really wants to be.</p> <p>Timely and inspiring,<i>Hero</i> tackles love, friendship, and the struggle to come to terms with who we really are in a sincere and suspenseful way.</p> <p>This audiobook includes an exclusive introduction written and read by Stan Lee himself.</p>";
