window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Beneath the water the body sank rapidly. She would lie still and undisturbed for many years, but above her on dry land, the nightmare was just beginning.</b> </p> <p>When Detective Erika Foster receives a tip-off that key evidence for a major narcotics case was stashed in a disused quarry on the outskirts of London, she orders for it to be searched. From the thick sludge the drugs are recovered, but so is the skeleton of a young child. The remains are quickly identified as seven-year-old Jessica Collins. The missing girl who made headline news 26 years ago. </p> <p>As Erika tries to piece together new evidence with the old, she must dig deeper and find out more about the fractured Collins family and the original detective, Amanda Baker - a woman plagued by her failure to find Jessica. Erika soon realizes this is going to be one of the most complex and demanding cases she has ever taken on. </p> <p><b>Is the suspect someone close to home? Someone is keeping secrets. Someone who doesn't want this case solved. And they'll do anything to stop Erika from finding the truth.</b> </p>";
