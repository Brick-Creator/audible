window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Humor, 2013</b></p> <p><i>\"Human beings fear the unknown. So, whatever's freaking you out, grab it by the balls and say hello. Then it ain't the unknown anymore and it ain't scary. Or I guess it could be a shitload scarier.\"</i> </p> <p>Fans of the number-one best seller <i>Sh*t My Dad Says</i> will recognize the always patient voice of Justin Halpern's dad as it crackles through this hysterical new audiobook. The story begins when Justin announces that he's decided to propose to his girlfriend. \"You've been dating her for four years,\" his dad replies. \"It ain't like you found a parallel f**king universe.\" </p> <p>But eventually he gives Justin some advice: that he should think back over everything he's learned in life about women, relationships, and himself before making his decision. And that's just what Justin does—revisiting everything from his disastrous childhood crushes to the night he finally lost his virginity while working as a dishwasher at Hooters. </p> <p>Full of his dad's patented brand of wisdom, it's also full of new characters just as funny—from his brother, who provides insights into wedding night rituals, to his first boss, who warns Justin to man up: \"That's what a man does. He takes his shots and then he scrubs the shit out of some dishes.\" The result is a pilgrim's progress through the landscape of sex and love—by one of the funniest writers at work today.</p>";
