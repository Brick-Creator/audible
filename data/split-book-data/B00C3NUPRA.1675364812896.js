window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>She only stepped outside for a minute… But a minute was all it took to turn Jean Kingsley’s world upside down - a minute she’d regret for the rest of her life. Stepping into her worst nightmare…Because when she returned, she found an open bedroom window and her three-year-old son, Nathan, gone. The boy would never be seen again. A nightmare that only got worse. A tip eventually leads detectives to their killer, a repeat sex offender, and inside his apartment, a gruesome discovery. A slam-dunk trial sends him off to death row, then several years later, to the electric chair. Case closed. Justice served…or was it? </p> <p>Now, more than 30 years later, Patrick Bannister unwittingly stumbles across evidence among his dead mother’s belongings. It paints her as the killer and her brother, a wealthy and powerful senator, as the one pulling the strings. What really happened to Nathan Kingsley? There’s a hole in the case a mile wide, and Patrick is determined to close it. But what he doesn’t know is that the closer he moves toward the truth, the more he’s putting his life on the line, that he’s become the hunted.</p>";
