window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From a hardscrabble village in Nova Scotia to the collapsing trenches of France, a debut novel about a family divided by World War I. In the tradition of Robert Goolrick's <i>A Reliable Wife</i> and Karl Marlantes's <i>Matterhorn,</i> P. S. Duffy's astonishing debut showcases a rare and instinctive talent emerging in midlife. Her novel leaps across the Atlantic, between a father at war and a son coming of age at home without him. </p><p>When his beloved brother-in-law goes missing at the front in 1916, Angus defies his pacifist upbringing to join the war and find him. Assured a position as a cartographer in London, he is instead sent directly into the visceral shock of battle. Meanwhile, at home, his son, Simon Peter, must navigate escalating hostility in a fishing village torn by grief. </p><p>With the intimacy of <i>The Song of Achilles</i> and the epic scope of <i>The Invisible Bridge, The Cartographer of No Man's Land</i> offers a soulful portrayal of World War I and the lives that were forever changed by it, both on the battlefield and at home.</p>";
