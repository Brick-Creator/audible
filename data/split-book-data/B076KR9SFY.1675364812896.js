window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Detective Angie Pallorino took down a serial killer permanently and, according to her superiors, with excessive force. Benched on a desk assignment for twelve months, Angie struggles to maintain her sense of identityâ€”if she's not a detective, who is she? Then a decades-old cold case washes ashore, pulling her into an investigation she recognizes as deeply personal.</p> <p>Angie's lover and partner, James Maddocks, sees it, too. But spearheading an ongoing probe into a sex-trafficking ring while keeping Angie's increasing obsession with her case in check is taking its toll. As startling connections between the parallel investigations emerge, Maddocks realizes he has even more than Angie's emotional state to worry about.</p> <p>Driven and desperate to solve her case, Angie goes rogue, risking her relationship, career, and very life in pursuit of answers. She'll learn that some truths are too painful to bear, and some sacrifices include collateral damage.</p> <p>But Angie Pallorino won't let it go. She can't. It's not in her blood.</p>";
