She spends her summer camping with her father, playing her beloved record of <i>The Railway Children</i>, and listening to her mother's grand piano, but her pretty life is about to change. </p> <p>Her survivalist father, who has been stockpiling provisions for the end, which is surely coming soon, takes her from London to a cabin in a remote European forest. There he tells Peggy the rest of the world has disappeared. </p> <p>Her life is reduced to a piano that makes music but no sound and a forest where all that grows is a means of survival. And a tiny wooden hut that is everything.</p>";
