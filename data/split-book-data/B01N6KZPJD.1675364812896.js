window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A woman dies in his arms...a drug dealer offers him $10,000...a gunman is determined to kill him. And then everything went to hell. </p> <p>Shelby Alexander is an aging ex-boxer and retired fixer whose activities often flirted with the wrong side of the law. Looking for a little peace and a slower pace of life, he moved to Serenity, the small Michigan town where he grew up. But trouble follows men like Shelby, and he finds himself embroiled in an underworld of drugs and violence that may prove to be his undoing. </p> <p>It seemed so simple: 10 grand to ask a few questions. He should have known money complicates everything, especially when the infamous Ellis family is involved, and when a small army of downstate dealers and a shadowy gunman all turn their sights on him, Shelby decides things have gone far enough. And he won't let the law stand in his way. </p> <p>The first book in the new Shelby Alexander Thriller series, <i>Serenity</i> is an action-packed audiobook with a lovingly rendered cast, witty dialogue, and a main character who doesn't know when to quit. </p>";
