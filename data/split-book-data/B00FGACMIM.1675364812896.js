window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the year 1833, two young brothers journey into the Wild West to seek their fortune; little do they know they're embarking on the adventure of their lives. Expecting to stumble upon riches as they make their way westward, sixteen-year-old Dillon Griffith and his older brother Owen instead encounter hardship after hardship in the form of Indian raids, bloodthirsty villains, robbery, and kidnapping. With the help of a Shawnee trapper and scout, a runaway slave-turned-mountain man, and a beautiful American Indian warrior, the brothers battle the unexpected setbacks and obstacles that life in the West throws their way, and endeavor to find their place on the American frontier. </p><p>Packed full of riveting action, gore, and vengeance, <i>Deadville</i> paints a thrilling - and historically pristine - picture of life in the Old West, from the physical environment to the social and economic milieus of frontier society. Jones' famously meticulous research, inviting literary style, and suspenseful plot succeed in transporting listeners to a time when lawlessness prevailed and buffalo roamed - when the belief in Manifest Destiny took America by storm and changed the country forever.</p>";
