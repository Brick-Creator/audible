window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of <i>Population: 485</i> returns, delivering a truckload of humor, heart, and... gardening tips? Think <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,</i> complete with stock cars, sexy vegetables, and a laugh track. </p> <p>\"All I wanted to do was fix my old pickup truck,\" says Michael Perry. \"That, and plant my garden. Then I met this woman....\" <i>Truck: A Love Story</i> recounts a year in which Perry struggles to grow his own food (\"Seed catalogs are responsible for more unfulfilled fantasies than Enron and <i>Penthouse</i> combined\"), live peaceably with his neighbors (one test-fires his black powder rifle in the alley; another's best Sunday shirt reads \"100 PERCENT WHUP-ASS\"), and sort out his love life. But along the way, he sets his hair on fire, is attacked by wild turkeys, takes a date to the fire department chicken dinner, and proposes marriage to a woman in New Orleans. </p> <p>As with <i>Population: 485,</i> much of the spirit of <i>Truck: A Love Story</i> may be found in the characters Perry meets: a one-eyed land surveyor, a paraplegic biker who rigs a sidecar so that his quadriplegic pal can ride along, a bartender who refuses to sell light beer, an enchanting woman who never existed, and half the staff of National Public Radio. </p> <p>By turns hilarious and heartfelt, a tale that begins on a pile of sheep manure, detours to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and returns to the deer-hunting swamps of northern Wisconsin, <i>Truck: A Love Story</i> becomes a testament to the surprising and unintended consequences of love.</p>";
