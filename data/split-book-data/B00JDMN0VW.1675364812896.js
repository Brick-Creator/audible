window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One hundred and two years ago Teddy Roosevelt split the Republican Party to advance his progressive agenda. Progressivism, or Big Government Republicanism, became the philosophy of the Republican Party's establishment elite. Fifty years ago conservatives began a battle for control of the party. Now is the time for conservatives to finish the job and take back the Republican Party. All national polls show that the American people self-identify as conservatives by a margin of 2 to 1 or more. Despite the scandals surrounding the White House, the outrageous failure of ObamaCare, and the lack of leadership from Congress, the Republican Party has failed to win key elections because it has failed to deliver on its promises to roll back the tide of Big Government. </p><p>In <i>Takeover</i>, prominent Republican strategist and fundraiser Richard Viguerie outlines the way to establish limited-government constitutional conservatism as the governing philosophy of the Republican Party and sanity back to Congress and the White House. Viguerie details the storied history of the battle for the soul of Republican Party and offers practical advice and outlines the steps necessary for conservatives to win the civil war in the GOP and govern America by 2017.</p>";
