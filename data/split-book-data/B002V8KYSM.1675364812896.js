window.bookSummaryJSON = "Following a 30-year-old man named Rhonda suffering from depersonalization, <i>Some Things That Meant the World to Me</i> is a gritty and beautiful work that is creative and hypnotic, and should stand as an introduction of an original new voice to American literature.<p>When Rhonda was a child - abandoned and ignored by his mother; abused and misguided by his mother's boyfriend - he imagined the rooms of his home drifting apart from one another like separating continents. Years later, after an embarassing episode as an adult, Rhonda's inner-child appears, leading him to a trapdoor in the bottom of a dumpster behind a taqueria that will force him to finally confront his troubled past. </p><p>In the spirit of <i>Cruddy</i> and <i>Hairstyles of the Damned</i>, Joshua Mohr has created a remarkable and unforgettable character in this charmingly poetic and maturely crafted first novel.</p>";
