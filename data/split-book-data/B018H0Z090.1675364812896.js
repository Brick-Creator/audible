window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Leading Harvard Medical School expert and \"obesity warrior\" (<i>Time</i> magazine) rewrites the rules on weight loss, diet, and health.</b> </p> <p>Forget everything you've been taught about dieting. In <i>Always Hungry?</i>, renowned endocrinologist Dr. David Ludwig explains why traditional diets don't work and presents a radical new plan to help you lose weight without hunger, improve your health, and feel great. </p> <p>For over two decades, Dr. Ludwig has been at the forefront of research into weight control. His groundbreaking studies show that overeating doesn't make you fat; the process of getting fat makes you overeat. That's because fat cells play a key role in determining how much weight you gain or lose. Low-fat diets work against you by triggering fat cells to hoard more calories for themselves, leaving too few for the rest of the body. This \"hungry fat\" sets off a dangerous chain reaction that leaves you feeling ravenous as your metabolism slows down. Cutting calories only makes the situation worse - creating a battle between mind and metabolism that we're destined to lose. You gain more weight even as you struggle to eat less food. </p> <p><i>Always Hungry?</i> turns dieting on its head with a three-phase program that ignores calories and targets fat cells directly. The recipes and meal plan include luscious high-fat foods (like nuts and nut butters, full-fat dairy, avocados, and dark chocolate), savory proteins, and natural carbohydrates. The result? Fat cells release their excess calories, and you lose weight - and inches - without battling cravings and constant hunger. This is dieting without deprivation. </p> <p>Forget calories. Forget cravings. Forget dieting. <i>Always hungry?</i> reveals a liberating new way to tame hunger and lose weight...for good. </p>";
