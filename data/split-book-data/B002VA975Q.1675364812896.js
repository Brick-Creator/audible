window.bookSummaryJSON = "Perhaps the most haunting and tragic love story ever written, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is the tale of Heathcliff, a brooding, troubled orphan, and his doomed love for Catherine Earnshaw. His desire for her leads him to madness when Catherine is made to marry a wealthy lord, sending Heathcliff on a lifelong quest to avenge himself upon those who stole his only love and his life. <p>In this gripping chronicle of the never-ending conflict between the heart and the mind - and the pain and passion of true romance - Emily Brontë created an unforgettable classic saga of love, desperation, vengeance, and forgiveness. Published just one year before Brontë's death in 1848 at the age of 30, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> endures as one of the world's greatest love stories and a classic of English literature.</p>";
