window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Willi Kufult, prison life means staying out of trouble, keeping his cell clean, snagging a precious piece of tobacco, and dreaming of the day of his release. Then he gets out. </p><p>As Willi tries to make a new life for himself in Hamburg, finding a job and even love, he still cannot escape his past. Gradually he becomes sucked into a world of drink, desperation, deceit, and, with one terrible act, he is ensnared in a noose of his own making. </p><p>Hans Fallada, whose famous works include <i>Alone in Berlin</i> and <i>The Drinker</i>, brilliantly crafts this dark and moving novel, originally written in 1934, as he describes a seedy criminal underworld of shabby lives and violent deeds, showing how our actions always catch up with us. His work is unparalleled, and <i>Once a Jailbird</i> is a fantastic title to add to Fallada’s recently translated works. </p>";
