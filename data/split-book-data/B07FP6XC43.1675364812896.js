window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A tragic accident or a murder on a mountain? Inspector Drake’s first investigation takes him to the middle of Snowdonia, but can he uncover the truth?</b></p> <p>When two bodies are found sprawled at the bottom of the Devil's Kitchen in the mountains of Snowdonia, it looks like a murder-suicide. But something doesn't feel right to Detective Inspector Ian Drake, and his gut instinct has never let him down before.</p> <p>Drake suspects at least one of the deaths could be suspicious, but who would kill such an ordinary couple, and why? This might be Drake's first murder inquiry, but his years as a detective have taught him one thing - every murder has a motive, and every killer leaves a trace.</p> <p>If you enjoy crime mysteries, then you’ll love this prequel novella in the eight-book Inspector Drake series. If you enjoy clever, well-plotted mysteries with engaging characters, then don’t miss Stephen Puleston’s Inspector Drake novels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
