window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After being educated in the east, Deborah Vandermark returns to Perkinsville, Texas, where her family is part of the thriving logging industry. She brings along an unexpected companion—her best friend, who is fleeing a wedding and groom she has no interest in. A determined matchmaker, Deborah sets her sights on uniting her brother and friend in what she hopes will be a true love match. Then Deborah meets Christopher Clayton, the town's new doctor—and quickly realizes she has a much greater interest in medicine and science than the bookkeeping she studied at college. Soon Deborah is caught between her fascination for doctoring and her obligation to her family. And in the midst of her warring emotions is the doctor himself. Are her tumultuous feelings for the man, or for what he can teach her?</p>";
