window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Arguably one of the most provocative, puzzling, and misunderstood organizations of medieval times, the legendary Knights Templar have always been shrouded in a veil of mystery, while inspiring popular culture from Indiana Jones to Dan Brown. </p> <p>The order of the Knights Templar was founded by Hugh de Payens, a French nobleman from the Champagne region, along with eight of his companions, in Jerusalem around 1119. </p> <p>They originally consisted of a group of knights who protected Christian pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land against attack from brigands and Saracen pirates, after the crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099. </p> <p>The order's full name was the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon. </p> <p>They were given quarters next to the temple and adopted their distinctive uniform - white tunics with an eight-pointed blood-red cross. </p> <p>In 1129 they took monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience and pledged themselves ready to die for their faith. </p> <p>They were gradually transformed into a chivalric order of warrior-monks who fought with distinction in the Crusades. </p>";
