She wants Burke to find a monster for her - so she can kill him with her bare hands. <p>In this thriller, Andrew Vachss's renegade private eye teams up with a lethally gifted avenger to follow a child's murderer through the catacombs of New York, where every alley is blind and the penthouses are as dangerous as the basements.<br>Fearfully knowing, crackling with narrative tension, and written in prose as forceful as a hollow-point slug, <i>Flood</i> is Burke at his deadliest - and Vachss at the peak of his form.</p>";
