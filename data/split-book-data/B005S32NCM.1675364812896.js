window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>His assignment from Satan was to kill Pastor Craig Groeschel. Today he sits on the front row of that pastor's church. For twenty years of his life, Michael Leehan lived and worked for Satan. At age 33, he made a decision to serve the darkness that he felt had consumed his life, but instead of making things easier, it began a steeper downward spiral replete with ritualistic cuttings, blood sacrifices, jail time, job loss, estrangement from his friends and family, and actual murderous assignments from Satan himself. <i>Ascent from Darkness</i> relates Michael’s gripping, real-life encounters, enslavement to the powers of darkness, and miraculous emancipation from the clutches of the Enemy. </p> <p>For anyone who has ever struggled with spiritual warfare, addiction, depression, or hopelessness, Michael’s story is a bold reminder of the redemptive truth of the gospel that anyone - even a soldier of Satan - can be transformed and used for the glory of God. </p> <p>Now a servant of Christ, Michael exhibits the power of God’s relentless love and offers listeners the chance to experience their own ascent into God’s glorious light.</p>";
