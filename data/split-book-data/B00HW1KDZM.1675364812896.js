window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When love sneaks up on you, shoot for the heart. Billy Bradford has a secret, and it's bigger than the fact that he's an assassin. When Tucker Hayes, Billy's \"straight\" best friend, is injured on a mission, Billy acts in haste, kissing Tucker. Shocked by the act, Tucker runs. But desire is stronger than convictions, leading Tucker to hunt down Billy. The other guys on the ranch are oblivious to Tucker and Billy's actions as they investigate a new target. Grant Stovall is hung up on his ex, but Roger Burk, their new operative, catches his attention and one small touch isn't enough. Meet the cowboys of Wild Bluff Ranch in the first audiobook of the Colorado Heart Series, Colorado Wild. </p>";
