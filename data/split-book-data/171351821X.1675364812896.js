window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the #1 Amazon Charts best-selling author of </b><b><i>Daughters of the Lake</i></b><b> comes an enthralling spellbinder of love, death, and a woman on the edge. </b></p> <p>After a devastating loss, Brynn Wilder escapes to Wharton, a tourist town on Lake Superior, to reset. Checking into a quaint boardinghouse for the summer, she hopes to put her life into perspective. In her fellow lodgers, she finds a friendly company of strangers: the frail Alice, cared for by a married couple with a heartbreaking story of their own; LuAnn, the eccentric and lovable owner of the inn; and Dominic, an unsettlingly handsome man inked from head to toe in mesmerizing tattoos.&nbsp;</p> <p>But in this inviting refuge, where a century of souls has passed, a mystery begins to swirl. Alice knows things about Brynn, about all of them, that she shouldn’t. Bad dreams and night whispers lure Brynn to a shuttered room at the end of the hall, a room still heavy with a recent death. And now she’s become irresistibly drawn to Dominic - even in the shadow of rumors that wherever he goes, suspicious death follows.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this chilling season of love, transformation, and fear, something is calling for Brynn. To settle her past, she may have no choice but to answer.</p>";
