window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Cold Hand in Mine</i> stands as one of Aickman's best collections and contains eight stories that show off his powers as a 'strange story' writer to the full. The listener is introduced to a variety of characters, from a man who spends the night in a Hospice to a German aristocrat and a woman who sees an image of her own soul. There is also a nod to the conventional vampire story (\"Pages from a Young Girl's Journal\") but all the stories remain unconventional and inconclusive, which perhaps makes them all the more startling and intriguing. </p> <p><i>Cold Hand in Mine</i> was first published in the UK in 1975 and in the US in 1977. The story <i>Pages from a Young Girl's Journal</i> won the Aickman World Fantasy Award in 1975. It was originally published in <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction in 1973 before appearing in this collection. </i></p> <p><i>This collection includes:</i></p> <ul> <li><i>\"The Swords\"</i></li> <li><i>\"The Real Road to the Church\"</i></li> <li><i>\"Niemandswasser\"</i></li> <li><i>\"Pages from a Young Girl’s Journal\"</i></li> <li><i>\"The Hospice\"</i></li> <li><i>\"The Same Dog\"</i></li> <li><i>\"Meeting Mr Millar\"</i></li> <li><i>\"The Clock Watcher\"</i></li> </ul> <p>Robert Fordyce Aickman was born in 1914 in London. In 1951, he published his first ghost stories in a volume called <i>We Are the Dark,</i> written in conjunction with Elizabeth Jane Howard, then went on to publish 11 further volumes of horror stories, two fantasy novels, and two volumes of autobiography. Dubbed ‘the supreme master of the supernatural’, he won a World Fantasy Award and British Fantasy Award for his short fiction, and also edited the first eight volumes of <i>The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories.</i> Aside from his writing, Aickman was passionate about preserving British canals and founded the Inland Waterways Association in 1946. He died in February 1981. </p> <p>Reece Shearsmith is a talented actor and writer. He is most famous for co-writing and starring in the award-winning <i>The League of Gentlemen,</i> along with Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss, and Jeremy Dyson. In 2009, Shearsmith and Pemberton won Best New Comedy at the 2009 British Comedy Awards for <i>Psychoville.</i> Reece Shearsmith has just finished filming Ben Wheatley’s horror <i>A Field in England,</i> out in July 2013. </p>";
