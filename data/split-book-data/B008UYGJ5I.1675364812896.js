window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"The war tried to kill us in the spring,\" begins this breathtaking account of friendship and loss. In Al Tafar, Iraq, 21-year-old Private Bartle and 18-year-old Private Murphy cling to life as their platoon launches a bloody battle for the city. In the endless days that follow, the two young soldiers do everything to protect each other from the forces that press in on every side: the insurgents, physical fatigue, and the mental stress that comes from constant danger. </p> <p>Bound together since basic training when their tough-as-nails sergeant ordered Bartle to watch over Murphy, the two have been dropped into a war neither is prepared for. As reality begins to blur into a hazy nightmare, Murphy becomes increasingly unmoored from the world around him and Bartle takes impossible actions. </p> <p>With profound emotional insight, especially into the effects of a hidden war on mothers and families at home, <i>The Yellow Birds</i> is a groundbreaking novel about the costs of war that is destined to become a classic.</p>";
