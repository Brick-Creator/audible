window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mike Walton had experienced terrorism from every angle. As a covert field operations officer, he thought he'd seen it all, but that was before terrorism struck him directly at home. Suffering devastating physical injury and unthinkable personal loss, Mike had one of two choices: give up or fight back, and giving up wasn't in his makeup. </p> <p>Mike and his wife, Lisa, a medical doctor and fellow counter-terrorism expert, are recruited by the International Market Stabilization Institute, a privately funded organization operating outside official channels to protect North America's financial interests. The strikes that destroyed Mike and Lisa's household - the work of Sheik Al-Assad - are bringing the Western economy to its knees. And they are only the beginning. If the Sheik succeeds, the world will change forever, and the next attack is just around the corner. Mike and Lisa must lead a hastily assembled team to Europe to stop the madness before time runs out. </p> <p>Rippling with tension, raging with action, and replete with the kinds of details only a true counter-terrorism insider can provide, <i>The Thin Black Line</i> is a nonstop thriller of the first order. It announces an unforgettable new team of characters and a distinctive new voice to the thriller world. </p>";
