window.bookSummaryJSON = "A half-starved young Russian man in a long black overcoat is smuggled into Hamburg at dead of night. He has an improbable amount of cash secreted in a purse around his neck. He is a devout Muslim. Or is he? He says his name is Issa. <p>Annabel, an idealistic young German civil rights lawyer, determines to save Issa from deportation. Soon her client's survival becomes more important to her than her own career -- or safety. In pursuit of Issa's mysterious past, she confronts the incongruous Tommy Brue, the sixty-year-old scion of Brue Frères, a failing British bank based in Hamburg.</p> <p>Annabel, Issa and Brue form an unlikely alliance -- and a triangle of impossible loves is born. Meanwhile, scenting a sure kill in the \"War on Terror,\" the rival spies of Germany, England and America converge upon the innocents.</p> <p>Thrilling, compassionate, peopled with characters the reader never wants to let go, <i>A Most Wanted Man</i> is a work of deep humanity and uncommon relevance to our times.</p>";
