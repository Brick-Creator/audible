This audiobook will only make it worse. </p> <p>Coming off the heels of <i>The Back Door Man</i>, Dave Buschi is back at the adrenaline game with <i>Proportionate Response</i> another thriller, another riveting story. </p> <p>Marks and Lip. One is a former Marine, the other is a former NSA cyber specialist. They know how to take down a target. You fix eyes on it, hit it, and exploit the site to find your next target. You proceed that way until you eventually take down the entire structure. Doing the \"consultant\" gig now, they're still tracking down threats. But this threat is a doozy. A mysterious threat, known as Client 487, is intent on planting seeds of dissent that will dismantle our very way of life. The more Marks and Lip discover, the more they realize this has been going on for some time. And it's ugly. </p>";
