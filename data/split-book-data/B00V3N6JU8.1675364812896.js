window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A captivating debut novel about brothers who have drifted apart and the accident that will determine their future, written by an unforgettable new voice in fiction. </p> <p>Some twins communicate in a secret language all their own. For Whiskey and Charlie Ferns, the two-way alphabet (alpha, bravo, charlie, delta) whispered back and forth over their crackly walkie-talkies is the best they can do. But as the brothers grow up, they grow apart. Whiskey is everything Charlie is not - bold, daring, carefree - and Charlie blames his brother for always stealing the limelight, always striving ahead while seeming to push Charlie back. By the time the twins reach adulthood, they are barely even speaking to each other. </p> <p>When Charlie hears that Whiskey has been in a terrible accident and has slipped into a coma, he is shocked...although perhaps not devastated. But as days and weeks slip by, and the chances of Whiskey's recovering grow ever more slim, Charlie is forced to look back on their lives and examine whether Whiskey's actions were truly as unforgivable as Charlie believed them to be. </p>";
