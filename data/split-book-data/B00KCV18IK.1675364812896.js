But perhaps it has changed one man most of all. This is the true rags-to-riches, recluse-to-extrovert, fat-to-skinny ShoeMoney Story. </p> <p>Penned with the same irreverence for authority and grammar as his widely read blog, Shoemoney.com, <i>Nothing's Changed but My Change</i> chronicles the journey from a difficult childhood as the fat \"dumb\" kid to a grown-up place of prominence, wealth, and happiness as one of the world's foremost Internet marketers. At times it's philosophical, provocative, and downright hilarious and at others it's a cursory how-to manual for making a buck and spending it wildly. </p> <p>Transparent and shockingly honest, you can't help but like and identify with the brazen narrator and finish his story with a renewed sense of your own self-confidence and hope. In the end, Schoemaker - the man behind the alias - leaves us with a final understanding that anything's possible if you celebrate yourself and embrace your natural talents because - as he's learned - that's the stuff that never changes.</p> <p></p>";
