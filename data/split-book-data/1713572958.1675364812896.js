window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A merciless killer who will stop at nothing. And a detective with nothing left to lose. </b></p> <p>When Detective Karen Hart hears a scream echoing out of beautiful Lincoln Cathedral one snowy evening, she is the first officer on the scene. In the chapel a man lies murdered, a bloody cross carved into his forehead.&nbsp;</p> <p>The twisted killing sends this close-knit community into shock. And a note to the police from the murderer, signed by \"The Cleanser\", confirms their worst fears: this sadistic slaying is the first of many. The ritual killings will never stop until Hart uncovers the murderer’s ungodly motive.</p> <p>When early leads become dead ends, Karen starts to wonder if there’s a link to a rumoured conspiracy within police ranks - particularly when an abrasive new officer is assigned to the case. Could the key to catching \"The Cleanser\" be dangerously close to home? Meanwhile, she is battling her own demons as she struggles to come to terms with the deaths of her husband and daughter.</p> <p>In her toughest case yet, Karen will come closer than ever before to a dangerous truth. Can she put the pieces of the puzzle together before she’s stopped in her tracks?</p>";
