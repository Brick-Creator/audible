window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b> Audie Award Nominee, Literary Fiction, 2013</b> </p> <p>A heartwarming novel about larger-than-life characters and second chances.... </p> <p>Former academic Arthur Opp weighs 550 pounds and hasn’t left his rambling Brooklyn home in a decade. Twenty miles away in Yonkers, seventeen-year-old Kel Keller navigates life as the poor kid in a rich school and pins his hopes on what seems like a promising baseball career - if he can untangle himself from his family drama. The link between this unlikely pair is Kel’s mother, Charlene, a former student of Arthur’s. After nearly two decades of silence, it is Charlene’s unexpected phone call to Arthur - a plea for help - that jostles them into action. Through Arthur and Kel’s own quirky and lovable voices,&nbsp;Heft&nbsp;tells the winning story of two improbable heroes whose sudden connection transforms both their lives. Like Elizabeth McCracken’s&nbsp;<i>The Giant’s House</i>,&nbsp;<i>Heft</i>&nbsp;is a novel about love and family found in the most unexpected places.</p>";
