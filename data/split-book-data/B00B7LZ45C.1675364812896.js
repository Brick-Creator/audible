window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If you're on vacation, fly coach. If you're on business, fly first class. If you're on a mission, fly with Mickey. Tony Boccaccio is after a bag of cash that he believes is his. Max Burke thinks otherwise and has hired two couriers to take the money to California. Mickey Soto is a commercial pilot hauling freight and instructing students from a small, Florida airport. Tony hires Mickey and his airplane to go after the couriers. Mickey thought his days of flying illegal cargo were behind him, but the lure of easy money and his policy of 'don't ask/don't tell' cause him to add to his history of poor decisions. Tony's cousin, Gina, jumps in to help, and the three of the end up in a desperate cross-crountry race that leads to a West Coast pier and a fateful decision by Tony that impacts their lives in ways that none of them could have foreseen.</p>";
