window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now an Academy Award-winning Netflix film by Jane Campion, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst:&nbsp;Thomas Savage's acclaimed Western is \"a pitch-perfect evocation of time and place\" (</b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><b>) for fans of </b><b><i>East of Eden</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Brokeback Mountain</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Set in the wide-open spaces of the American West, <i>The Power of the Dog</i> is a stunning story of domestic tyranny, brutal masculinity, and thrilling defiance from one of the most powerful and distinctive voices in American literature. The novel tells the story of two brothers—one magnetic but cruel, the other gentle and quiet—and of the mother and son whose arrival on the brothers’ ranch shatters an already tenuous peace. From the novel’s startling first paragraph to its very last word, Thomas Savage’s voice—and the intense passion&nbsp;of his characters—holds listeners in thrall.</p> <p><b>\"Gripping and powerful...A work of literary art.\"&nbsp;—Annie Proulx, from her afterword</b></p>";
