window.bookSummaryJSON = "Leading health blogger Jimmy Moore and researcher and internist Dr. Eric C. Westman join forces again to explain the powerful therapeutic effects of a ketogenic diet—one that combines a customized carbohydrate restriction, moderation of protein intake, and real food-based fats—which is emerging in the scientific literature as a means for improving a wide range of diseases, from Type 2 diabetes to Alzheimer's and more. Simply eating a low-carb diet alone isn't enough, and Moore and Westman tell you why. Have you looked at a low-carb diet simply as a means to lose weight? What if you learned that combining a low-carb nutritional approach with a high fat intake produces a powerful therapeutic effect on a wide variety of health conditions that most people think requires medication to control? That’s what Keto Clarity is all about. Jimmy Moore, a leading low-carb diet blogger and podcaster, has reunited with his Cholesterol Clarity co-author Dr. Eric C. Westman, a practicing internist and low-carb diet researcher, to bring you the crystal-clear information you need to understand what a ketogenic diet is and why it may be the missing element in your pursuit of optimal health. This book includes exclusive interviews from twenty of the world's foremost authorities from various fields bringing their depth of expertise and experience using this nutritional approach. Moore and Westman explain why ketosis is normal and how this nutritional approach is being used therapeutically by many medical professionals. You will find a step-by-step guide to help you produce more ketones and track your progress, real life success stories, and more. The solid evidence for nutritional ketosis in dealing with many of the chronic health problems of our day is presented, including but not limited to: epilepsy, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome.";
