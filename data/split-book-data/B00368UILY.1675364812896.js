window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you dread conversation at Christmas dinner with your Catholic family? At weddings, funerals, and holidays?</p> <p>Chris Castaldo has wrestled personally with this question and many more. Perhaps you have too. Whether you are a former Roman Catholic or know someone who is, you’ll find helpful answers and encouraging support within these pages.</p> <p>Like: how can Evangelicals and Catholics reach such different conclusions from the same Scripture? When I talk about my faith with my Catholic family, why does someone always get upset? How does my Catholic background still influence my views of God and salvation? And how should I talk with my Catholic friends about Jesus?</p> <p>More than providing historical perspective, theological reflection, and practical lessons, Holy Ground is a dynamic exploration of how to emulate both the grace and truth of the Lord Jesus Christ in relation to the Catholic people you love.</p>";
