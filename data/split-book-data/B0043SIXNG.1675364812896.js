window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Awakened by radio broadcasts urging the residents of a small Virginia town to take a snow day rather than travel to school and work, Peter Boyd finds himself with both an unexpected day off and an opportunity to find big truths in small moments and surprise encounters. Peter believes he has a good life, with a decent job and a family he loves. But he’s quietly worried he’ll be cut when downsizing takes effect at the factory, his family will lose the home they love, and his faith will crumble along with his bank account. </p> <p>Through the course of one day, Peter finds himself revisiting his past through old friends, finding out there is a Santa Claus - though he drives a truck instead of a sleigh - and rediscovering that whatever comes in life, hope is the only choice that makes sense. </p> <p>Debut novelist Billy Coffey offers a heartwarming and beautiful story about the faithful way God speaks, even when we won’t listen. Like Peter, you’ll reaffirm that faith is worth having and your worst fears are no match for an astounding, loving God.</p>";
