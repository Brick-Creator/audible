window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A fisherman lies dead. A beautiful girl is strangled. Can Detective Drake uncover the secrets that connect them?</b></p> <p>Welsh Inspector Ian Drake is back on duty, but struggles as he comes to terms with his father’s death. When a fisherman is found impaled on the sand in a small island community, Drake comes up against a wall of silence.</p> <p>When a young girl is killed, Drake is stumped by the motive for her death. But with lots of money at stake with the development of a nearby nuclear power station, Drake believes there are powerful forces at work.</p> <p>Images recovered from a computer suggest a more sinister motive behind the deaths, and when one of the suspects commits suicide, the pressure mounts on Drake. And how far will people go to protect their way of life and language?</p> <p>Can he expose the truth and catch the killer...or killers?</p> <p><i>Against the Tide</i> is the third book in the dynamic Inspector Drake crime series. If you like police procedurals, clever mysteries, and gripping thrillers, then you’ll love Stephen Puleston’s unnerving whodunit.</p>";
