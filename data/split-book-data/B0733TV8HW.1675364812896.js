window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The second in the terrifying DI Callanach crime series.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the midst of a rock festival, a charity worker is sliced across the stomach. He dies minutes later. In a crowd of thousands, no one saw his attacker. The following week, the body of a primary school teacher is found in a Dumpster in an Edinburgh alley, strangled with her own woolen scarf.&nbsp;</p> <p>DI Ava Turner and DI Luc Callanach have no motive and no leads - until around the city, graffitied on buildings, words appear describing each victim.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's only when they realise the words are appearing before rather than after the murders that they understand the killer is announcing his next victim...and the more innocent the better.&nbsp;</p>";
