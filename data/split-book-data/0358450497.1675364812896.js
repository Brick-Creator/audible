window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>FINALIST FOR THE NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD</b></p> <p><b>\"[Miller’s] character portraits are indelible, often heartbreaking. At times this novel moved me to tears, the highest possible compliment.”</b></p> <p><b>—</b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p> <p><b>With the wit and scope of Michael Chabon’s </b><b><i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,</i></b><b> Derek B. Miller tackles his most ambitious epic yet. At its heart is the return of Sheldon Horowitz, the protagonist from Miller’s award-winning first novel, </b><b><i>Norwegian by Night,</i></b><b> who was lauded by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo as “one of the most memorable characters . . . that I’ve encountered in years.”</b></p> <p><b>MEET SHELDON IN THE MORNING OF HIS LIFE</b></p> <p>Twelve-year old Sheldon Horowitz is still recovering from the tragic loss of his mother only a year ago when a suspicious traffic accident steals the life of his father near their home in rural Massachusetts. It is 1938, and Sheldon, who was in the truck, emerges from the crash an orphan hell-bent on revenge. He takes that fire with him to Hartford, where he embarks on a new life under the roof of his buttoned-up Uncle Nate. Sheldon, his teenage cousins Abe and Mirabelle, and his best friend, Lenny, will contend with tradition and orthodoxy, appeasement and patriotism, mafia hitmen and angry accordion players, all while World War II takes center stage alongside a hurricane in New England and comedians in the Catskills. With his eye always on vengeance for his father’s murder, Sheldon stakes out his place in a world he now understands is comprised largely of crimes: right and wrong, big and small.</p> <p><b>“For me—as I’m certain it will be for every reader of the wonderful </b><b><i>Norwegian By Night</i></b><b>—Derek B. Miller’s new novel is a genuine literary event (Sheldon Horowitz is back!). Miller has long deserved to be a household name. </b><b><i>How to Find Your Way in the Dark</i></b><b> should finally make him one.\"</b></p> <p><b>—Richard Russo, author of </b><b><i>Empire Falls</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Chances Are...</i></b></p>";
