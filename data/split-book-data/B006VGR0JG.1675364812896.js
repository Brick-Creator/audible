window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For third-generation Irish-American Sean Corrigan, the past is whatever happened yesterday. Then, on his 21st birthday, his father gives him a musty leather-bound journal that changes his life. Written by his uncle, Michael, a man Sean never even knew existed, it draws Sean into a hunt for the truth. Did Michael, a former NYPD detective, really kill a black civil rights worker? When he fled the United States to hide in Ireland, why was he killed by the British? Who is the beautiful, auburn-haired Kate, and why does Sean feel so strongly that he remembers her? </p><p>Determined to solve the mystery of his uncleâ€™s murder, Sean travels to Ireland, where he is caught up in the lives of people who not only know about Michael but have a score to settle. As his connection to his uncle grows stronger, Sean realizes that the journal also carries the story of his own life - his past as well as his future.</p>";
