window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After enduring a childhood of horrific abuse and crushing poverty, Tucker seeks refuge in her rural Tennessee home. The three grandchildren she is raising are her only connection to the outside, and her demeanor is purposefully rough. But her world is turned upside down when a new neighbor, Ella, moves into the old McDaniel place next door. </p> <p>Ella seeks solace on the same country road after overcoming cancer. Although she is Tucker's peer agewise, she was raised in a world of privilege and opportunity. Still, Ella shares a tragic part of Tucker's experience - she also suffered abuse. Hers was at the hands of her husband, a prominent judge in the community and Tucker's sworn enemy. </p> <p>When Tucker finds herself at risk of losing custody of her beloved youngest grandchild and worse, the child's mother is murdered, she draws support and strength from her new friendship with Ella. These two women from disparate backgrounds form a fierce bond, and they weather life's storms together with faith, love, and determination. </p>";
