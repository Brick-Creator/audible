Translated into over a dozen languages. </p> <p>They killed Patton when he opposed them. They've cowered Presidents into going to war. For more than half a century, a secret organization of Army officers known as The Line has been covertly manipulating US Policy. Now, in a political climate rife with dissent and unrest, The Line has ordered a pivotal top-secret operation that will let the world know who is really in charge: take out the President on Pearl Harbor Day. But The Line didn't count on Boomer Watson, a member of the Army's elite Delta Force and Major Benita Trace, both West Point graduates, staying true to their oath of allegiance and willing to fight The Line with their lives. </p> <p>From The Ukraine to Pearl Harbor to West Point to the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia, it's a race against time to stop The Line as December 7th looms. </p> <p>Written by a West Point graduate, former Green Beret and NY Times Bestselling author, this book crackles with authenticity and action.</p>";
