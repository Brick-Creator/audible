window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Graduate students Zoë and Holli only mean to blow off some steam on their road trip to Las Vegas. But something goes terribly wrong on their way home, and the last time Zoë sees her, Holli is in the clutches of a sadistic killer. Zoë flees with her life, changed forever. </p> <p>A year later and still tortured with guilt, Zoë latches on to a police investigation where the crime eerily resembles her abduction. Along with a zealous detective, she retraces the steps of that fateful night in the desert, hoping that her memory will return and help them find justice for Holli. Her abductor--labeled the \"Tally Man\" by a fascinated media--lies in wait for Zoë. For him, she is not a survivor but simply the one that got away. </p> <p>With an unforgettable heroine, a chillingly disturbed psychopath, and a story that moves at breakneck speed, <i>The One That Got Away</i> is thriller writer Simon Wood at his finest. </p>";
