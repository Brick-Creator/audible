window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Tony, something’s wrong inside the Met. It’s upside down. Like looking at the skyline and seeing Elizabeth Tower on her head. You sense it, don’t you?\"</p> <p>For Lord Anthony Hetheridge, this wet April should be full of promise. His wife, Kate, is on bedrest for her final month of pregnancy, and his friend DI Deepal \"Paul\" Bhar's firstborn, a darling baby girl, has already arrived. Wellegrave House is restored, and the Hetheridges are back where they belong, in the heart of Mayfair. But inside Scotland Yard, the institution Tony served for so many years, something is very wrong.</p> <p>When the body of Tony's former protege, DC Amelia Gulls, is found murdered in her flat, suspicion immediately falls on her boyfriend, DC Sean Kincaid. And when Paul calls in Tony to assist with the investigation, they turn up more questions than answers. Before her death, Gulls was working on three cold cases: a kept woman hurled out the window of her fourth-floor love nest, a uni student who drowned in the Thames, and a retired detective's drug-addicted son found dead under a tree. As Tony probes these seemingly unsolvable cases, he draws closer to a shocking truth - and a dangerous reckoning.</p> <p><i>Untrue Blue </i>is the seventh book in the ongoing Lord and Lady Hetheridge Mystery Series. The series' first omnibus, <i>Deadly Trio</i>, appeared on both the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-seller lists, and all the books have made appearances, often at number one, on Kindle best-seller lists. The author, Emma Jameson, would like to take this opportunity to once again to thank for the lovely messages of support. The most common question she's asked is, \"Will you keep writing Lord and Lady Hetheridge books?\" The answer is a resounding yes.</p>";
