window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A left-leaning judge liberates four of the most dangerous al-Qaeda terrorists from Guantanamo Bay and the CIA field officers track them back to Pakistan's northwest frontier mountain range. But the men vanish and rejoin the dark and mysterious forces trained by Osama bin Laden high in the Hindu Kush. These are men with hatred for the United States and Great Britain, and they are sworn to hit back at the USA, which imprisoned so many of their high command. They know there is only one man who can stop them--retired Navy SEAL Lt. Commander Mack Bedford--and he is called in to assist on one of the most highly classified missions ever launched from CIA headquarters.</p>";
