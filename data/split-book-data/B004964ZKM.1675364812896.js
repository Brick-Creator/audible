window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A secret history of the industrial wars behind the rise and fall of the 20th century's great information empires - Hollywood, the broadcast networks, and AT&amp;T - asking one big question: Could history repeat itself, with one giant entity taking control of American information? </p> <p>Most consider the Internet Age to be a moment of unprecedented freedom in communications and culture. But as Tim Wu shows, each major new medium, from telephone to cable, arrived on a similar wave of idealistic optimism only to become, eventually, the object of industrial consolidation profoundly affecting how Americans communicate. Every once-free and open technology was in time centralized and closed, a huge corporate power taking control of the master switch. Today, as a similar struggle looms over the Internet, increasingly the pipeline of all other media, the stakes have never been higher. To be decided: who gets heard, and what kind of country we live in. Part industrial expos√©, part meditation on the nature of freedom of expression, part battle cry to save the Internet's best features, <i>The Master Switch</i> brings to light a crucial drama rife with indelible characters and stories, heretofore played out over decades in the shadows of our national life.</p>";
