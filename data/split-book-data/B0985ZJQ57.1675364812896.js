window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Could you obey an order that might cost you everything?</p> <p>When the director of a local veterans’ charity is found murdered on the steps of a war memorial, it seems like a straightforward case of random street violence. But similarities with a previous death arouse Blake’s suspicions and the apparently well-loved victim turns out to have had hidden flaws and many enemies. Blake is drawn into a web of intrigue and danger as he investigates the murder. Could it be terrorist activity? Is a psychotic serial killer stalking veterans? Or is there another explanation? As Blake wrestles with this most delicate and troubling of cases, he hears news that his partner, Laura Vexley has returned to the Wirral, but something is not right. A bombshell revelation means he must avoid contact with her or lose his job. Can Blake keep his professional integrity and solve the murders before the killer strikes again?</p> <p>Oh and watch out, Serafina the cat has tooth ache...</p> <p><i>All the Lies</i> is the fifth book from popular crime author J.E. Mayhew and is ideal for fans of JD Kirk, LJ Ross, Alex Smith, and Luca Veste.</p>";
