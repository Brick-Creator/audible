window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sun was rising over Moat County, Florida, when Sheriff Thurmond Call was found on the highway, gutted like an alligator. A local redneck was tried, sentenced, and set to fry. </p> <p>Then Ward James, a hotshot investigative reporter for the&nbsp;<i>Miami Times</i>, returns to his rural hometown with a death row femme fatale who promises him the story of the decade. She’s armed with explosive evidence and aims to free - and meet - her convicted “fiancé.” </p> <p>With Ward’s disillusioned younger brother Jack as their driver, they barrel down Florida’s back roads and seamy places in search of the story, racing flat out into a shocking head-on collision between character and fate as truth takes a backseat to headline news. </p> <p>Pete Dexter is the author of the National Book Award–winning novel <i>Paris Trout</i>, among others. He has been a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News and the Sacramento Bee and has contributed to many magazines, including Esquire, Sports Illustrated, and Playboy. His screenplays include Rush and Mulholland Falls. </p>";
