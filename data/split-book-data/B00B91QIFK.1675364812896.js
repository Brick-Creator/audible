window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the most remarkable novels of the Holocaust ever written, <i>Jakob the Liar</i> is a tale of everyday heroism and the extraordinary power of illusion. Set in an unnamed German-occupied ghetto, the story centers on an unlikely hero, Jakob Heym, who accidentally overhears news of vital importance: The Russians are advancing on a city 300 miles away. As Jakob's tidings rekindle hope and the promise of liberation, he feels compelled to elaborate. Forming a protective bond with a young orphan girl, Jakob becomes caught in his own web of optimistic lies. </p><p>Awarded Germany's prestigious Heinrich Mann Prize for fiction and in a new translation by Leila Vennewitz, <i>Jakob the Liar</i> is a masterpiece of Kafkaesque comedy which unfolds with the impact of a timeless folk legend.</p>";
