window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of Audible UKâ€™s 2017 Narrator of the Year Award</b> </p> <p>Introducing Audible's Thriller of the Year: <i>Silent Child</i> by Sarah A. Denzil, performed by Joanne Froggatt. </p> <p>In the summer of 2006, Emma Price watched helplessly as her six-year-old son's red coat was fished out of the River Ouse. It was the tragic story of the year - a little boy, Aiden, wandered away from school during a terrible flood, fell into the river, and drowned. His body was never recovered. Ten years later Emma has finally rediscovered the joy in life. She's married, pregnant, and in control again...until Aiden returns. </p> <p>Too traumatised to speak, he raises endless questions and answers none. Where has he been? What happened to him on that rainy afternoon? And now that he's back, whom can he trust? </p> <p>At Audible we love listening to crime books. But every so often one comes along that we think is truly special. An Amazon Kindle number one best-seller, Sarah A. Denzil's <i>Silent Child</i> is taking Audible HQ by storm. In an Audible Exclusive production, Joanne Froggatt (Mrs Bates, <i>Downton Abbey</i>) delivers a powerhouse performance that will keep you gripped until the very last second. </p>";
