window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For many years, Dr. Wayne W. Dyerâ€™s fans have wondered when he would write a memoir. Well, Wayne has finally done just that! However, he has written it in a way that only he can - with a remarkable take-home message for his longtime followers and new readers alike - and the result is an exciting new twist on the old format. Rather than a plain old memoir, Wayne has gathered together quantum-moment recollections. </p> <p>In this revealing and engaging audiobook, Wayne shares dozens of events from his life, from the time he was a little boy in Detroit up to present day. In unflinching detail, he relates his vivid impressions of encountering many forks in the road, taking readers with him into these formative experiences. Yet then he views the events from his current perspective, noting what lessons he ultimately learned, as well as how he has made the resulting wisdom available to millions via his lifelong dedication to service. </p> <p><i>I Can See Clearly Now</i> is an intimate look at an amazing teacher, but it also holds the key for seekers on a personal path of enlightenment. Wayne offers up his own life as an example of how we can all recognize the hand of the Divine steering our individual courses, helping us accomplish the mission we came here to fulfill. </p>";
