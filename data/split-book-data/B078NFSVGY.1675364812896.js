window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It coulda been worse. </b>That's the \"working epitaph\" of 15-year-old Moon Landing. Not that Moon's death is imminent--far from it--but his thoughts have turned to gallows humor, as his world disintegrates along with his parents' marriage. His older brother skateboards through life with ease, but Moon is deeply troubled. Just as he is solving for romantic unknowns with a gorgeous older girl, Moon must contend with his dad's sudden absence, his mom-gone-wild's sexcapades, and his best friends' curious penchant for self-destruction. Not to mention his newfound role in agitating to end an African guerrilla's bloody rampage. To make sense of it all, Moon embarks on a quest to unravel the riddle of God's injustice to man. In this humorous and touching coming-of-age novel, Moon struggles to understand his parents--who they are, what brought them together, what broke them apart--and what that all means for his future.</p>";
