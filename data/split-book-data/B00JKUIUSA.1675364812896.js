window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Stressed out? Anxious? Overwhelmed? There’s good news - you’re not alone! No one ever said life was going to be easy. Between financial struggles, marital issues, health scares, and the run-of-the-mill problems of everyday life, it’s easy to feel weighed down and trapped by your circumstances. In times like these, it’s tempting to just throw in the towel and quit. </p> <p>Well, don’t do it! Perry Noble has stood at the edge of the abyss himself, and in <i>Overwhelmed</i>, he shares the keys to unlocking the chains of anxiety and despair once and for all. Building on the premise that everything changes when we shift our focus from our circumstances to Christ, Perry walks listeners through a life-altering plan for overcoming stress, worry, depression, and anxiety so we can be free to embrace the abundant, joy-filled lives we were created for. </p> <p>God knows we’re frustrated. He knows we’re tired. He knows we’re struggling. But He also knows how things are going to turn out. He is greater than anything you’re going through...so don’t give up on God. After all, He has never given up on you! </p>";
