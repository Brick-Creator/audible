window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p></p><p>Today’s most revered, feared, and controversial Chinese novelist, Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan, offers a tour de force in which the real, the absurd, the comical, and the tragic are blended into a fascinating narrative. The hero—or antihero—of Mo Yan’s new novel is Ximen Nao, a landowner known for his benevolence to his peasants. His story is a deliriously unique journey and absolutely riveting tale that reveals the author’s love of a homeland beset by ills inevitable, political, and traditional.</p>";
