window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sebastian Prendergast lives in a geodesic dome with his eccentric grandmother, who homeschooled him in the teachings of futurist philosopher R. Buckminster Fuller. But when his grandmother has a stroke, Sebastian is forced to leave the dome and make his own way in town. </p> <p>Jared Whitcomb is a chain-smoking 16-year-old heart-transplant recipient who befriends Sebastian and begins to teach him about all the things he has been missing, including grape soda, girls, and Sid Vicious. They form a punk band called The Rash, and it's clear that the upcoming Methodist Church talent show has never seen the likes of them. </p> <p>With storytelling that is fresh and vivid, <i>The House of Tomorrow</i> is destined to become an instant classic.</p>";
