window.bookSummaryJSON = "Brimming with enthralling details and personalities, Toby Lester's <i>The Fourth Part of the World</i> spotlights Martin Waldseemüller's 1507 world map and recounts the epic tale of the mariners and scholars who facilitated this watershed of Western history. Five hundred years ago, an obscure German scholar took a quantum leap in thought to design a groundbreaking map. It included such innovations as labeling a separate New World continent America and approximating the world as we know it today. Inherent in this magnificent masterpiece are clear echoes from the adventures of Marco Polo, the discoveries of Christopher Columbus, the explorations of Amerigo Vespucci, numerous Renaissance journeys, and much more. Fully realized by Peter Jay Fernandez's superb narration, this vivid account will help listeners appreciate why - in 2003 - the Library of Congress paid 10 million dollars for this 6-foot by 9.5-foot antiquity and the authenticating documents found with it in 1901.";
